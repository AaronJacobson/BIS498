I want to fix things, I reject partisan bickering, and I have a track record of guts, integrity, and success. Stand with me for unity, middle class jobs, and getting the money out of politics. Leaders who stir up division and anger are the root cause of our problems. They bicker while our problems get worse. Real leadership means unity, love toward all people, and smart problem-solving. Middle class jobs: Our economy is based on the skills and work ethic of our people. I stand for ten independent reforms for working families, including getting high school students more work experience; fiscal responsibility; high-demand job training and apprenticeship; and growing thousands of middle class jobs. Get the money out of politics: It’s just plain wrong that the middle class has less voice today, because we can’t write million dollar campaign checks. With courage and unity, let’s stand up and fix this. I love Clark County and all of its people. Independents, Democrats, and Republicans, we’re all in this together. As your Senator, I’ll lead us toward a powerful economy and a unified and compassionate society. Vote for Tim Probst, and build a future we all can be proud of.

Most importantly, I’ve kept my promise to put the interests of Clark County first, not the interests of big government bureaucrats and big-money special interest groups. As a mom, grandmother, and small business employer, I know that economic opportunity, job creation, and quality of life comes from a vibrant private sector, not from a government that spends, taxes, and regulates too much. Our families need more, and better jobs. Parents deserve an education system that puts their children first, gives them more options, and inspires their children to pursue their passions.

After 2016, tuition can only increase at the same rate as median wage growth. Sen. Schoesler led the drive to increase basic education funding by $4.5 billion. Sen.

Sue believes that increased regulations and taxes on small business in Washington have damaged our local economy. As a power manager working on large project approvals, Sue has personally seen how regulations impede important projects and job creation. Sue will work to add new jobs locally by offering incentives to small businesses, rather than stifling them with additional burdens. Not only have politicians in Olympia suppressed our local economy by being hostile to timber and small business, they have also failed our local schools. The state Supreme Court has ruled that education funding – especially in rural communities like ours – is unfair. Our local schools are being ignored in the state budget and local taxpayers are being forced to cover the cost. Sue will fight to correct this. Seattle-focused politicians and political parties have failed to fix the problems facing our community. As your Senator, Sue will push for fair funding to our local schools, fight back against job-killing taxes and overregulation, and prevent Olympia from infringing on our individual rights.

Sue Kuehl Pederson is running for the Senate to provide an independent choice for voters, and to ensure that Coastal Washington is heard in Olympia. Sue believes that increased regulations and taxes on small business in Washington have damaged our local economy. As a power manager working on large project approvals, Sue has personally seen how regulations impede important projects and job creation. Sue will work to add new jobs locally by offering incentives to small businesses, rather than stifling them with additional burdens. Not only have politicians in Olympia suppressed our local economy by being hostile to timber and small business, they have also failed our local schools. The state Supreme Court has ruled that education funding – especially in rural communities like ours – is unfair. Our local schools are being ignored in the state budget and local taxpayers are being forced to cover the cost. Sue will fight to correct this. Seattle-focused politicians and political parties have failed to fix the problems facing our community. As your Senator, Sue will push for fair funding to our local schools, fight back against job-killing taxes and overregulation, and prevent Olympia from infringing on our individual rights.

Served on Board of Health, Senior Services, Law and Justice, Salmon Recovery, Mental Health, and Northwest Clean Air Agency. Greatly improved transparency, increased public participation, and ensured veterans and military families get the support they deserve.	 Small business owner of Straight Edge Architecture, LLC; architect, carpenter, and machinist.	 BS in Architecture, Washington State University. Masters in Environmental Law and Policy, Vermont Law School. Attended Skagit Valley College.	 Founder of a non-profit advocating for transparent government and smart land use planning; public school volunteer teaching science, gardening, art, and architecture; PTA Golden Acorn Awardee.	 Washington has been my home for 30 years and Whidbey Island for 20, where my husband, a retired Naval Aviator, and I built our home and raised our two children. While volunteering to protect a public estuary, I discovered a gross abuse of public funds and began attending local government meetings. What I witnessed compelled me to fight for government that represents people. I became a commissioner when Island County was facing financial collapse. Working with bipartisan colleagues, we cut spending by 20%, streamlined departments, and froze elected official’s salaries. I prioritized living wage jobs, veterans services, affordable housing, public health and safety, water quality, and protecting the environment. To support parks, senior services and 4H, I donated over $40,000 of my salary. It’s time to replace politicians who spend your tax dollars on lobbyists, big corporations, and special interests. I will fight to bring our taxes home to fund education, promote Washington businesses, protect family farms, prioritize jobgenerating road, bridge, and ferry projects, and support a high quality of life. I will listen to, hear, and represent the people in our district. Together we can accomplish great things for today and tomorrow’s generations. I ask for your vote.

State Senator	5	Mark Mullet	(Prefers Democratic Party)	has_opponent	 Mark is our current State Senator.   He has been fighting on our behalf in Olympia since 2012. Mark was previously on the Issaquah City Council.	 Mark owns the Zeeks Pizza and Ben and Jerry’s in Issaquah.  As a small business owner Mark understands the importance of low taxes and smart regulations.	 A Bachelor’s in Finance, Indiana University, gave Mark the finance background to understand state budgets.  His Master’s in Public Affairs from the University of Washington taught Mark that great listeners make the best leaders.	 Rotary Club. Classroom volunteer in his four daughters’ schools. Former Issaquah Food Bank Board member.	 Mark has the most independent voting record in the Senate. He isn’t afraid to buck special interests or his own party to do what is right for our community. Mark is socially progressive and fiscally conservative. As a father of four daughters and the owner of Zeeks Pizza and Ben and Jerry’s Issaquah, Mark understands the state has two priorities; ensuring our children get the best education and keeping taxes low. Issaquah’s Mayor Fred Butler says, “Mark’s hard work and honesty enables him to work across the aisle to accomplish great things for our communities”. Mark got funding to decrease traffic congestion, including a new interchange at Highway 18 in Snoqualmie and additional lanes on I-90 between Issaquah and Bellevue. Mark stopped a high-density development in Maple Valley, secured land for a new Tahoma High school, and championed the renovation of Lake Sammamish State Park. Mark opposed the legislative pay raise in 2015, so he donates his entire raise each year to the local food bank. Mark is endorsed by the School Board Presidents of Issaquah and Snoqualmie, Mayors of Issaquah, Snoqualmie and Carnation, and the League of Education Voters. Please vote to “Bring back the Mullet”!

The Seattle Times called Chad “one of the clearest thinkers in the Legislature” and says he “brings much-needed moderation and intellectual rigor to Olympia.” A vote for Chad is a vote for integrity in state government.

We need leaders with common sense, experience and the ability to provide a positive direction in Olympia. Curtis provides all of these. This is why people across the 14th District are supporting the re-election of Curtis King for State Senator. “In 1987 our state biennial operating budget was $9.14 billion. Less than 30 years later our state budget is over $37 billion. that is an average increase of 14% per year. We do not have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem. Our state government has gone far beyond its core functions of educating our children, providing protection for its citizens and caring for our most vulnerable.

Board Member, Ghana Together; Board Member, Commencement Bay Rowing Club (youth program); Board Member, Small Faces Child Development Center.	 Sue Kuehl Pederson is running for the Senate to provide an independent choice for voters, and to ensure that Coastal Washington is heard in Olympia. Sue believes that increased regulations and taxes on small business in Washington have damaged our local economy. As a power manager working on large project approvals, Sue has personally seen how regulations impede important projects and job creation. Sue will work to add new jobs locally by offering incentives to small businesses, rather than stifling them with additional burdens. Not only have politicians in Olympia suppressed our local economy by being hostile to timber and small business, they have also failed our local schools. The state Supreme Court has ruled that education funding – especially in rural communities like ours – is unfair. Our local schools are being ignored in the state budget and local taxpayers are being forced to cover the cost. Sue will fight to correct this. Seattle-focused politicians and political parties have failed to fix the problems facing our community. As your Senator, Sue will push for fair funding to our local schools, fight back against job-killing taxes and overregulation, and prevent Olympia from infringing on our individual rights.

In the State Senate, I’ve worked hard to get results: protecting our individual rights and working with legislators from both parties for practical solutions. I haven’t missed a vote in six years. We increased school funding without raising taxes, lowered college tuition, and made strong investments in transportation. I wrote a law to crack down on red light cameras that were set to trap motorists into paying big fines. As Health Care Committee Chair, the patient is my number one priority. My telemedicine legislation was signed into law, to help bring the expertise of world-class specialists to rural areas and small towns. Four years from now, I’d like families and property owners to be able to say-thanks to Randi; I have more freedom to live my life without government interference. Randi is an avid fisher, hunter and NRA member. She and her husband, Bob, live on a small farm near Eatonville.	 (253) 208-6500; rbecker44106@gmail.com; randibecker.com

Graduated from Puyallup High School, U.S. Air Force Medical training during the first Gulf War. Earned my college degree while supporting my family.	 Director of Community Outreach at New Horizon Church in Fife. Built a team to provide food and other resources to the homeless and low-income families. 14 years coaching youth soccer.	 I’m a 4th generation Puyallup area resident. Raised in a lowincome household, I was taught a strong work ethic and the value of a great education. Education should level the playing field, but the legislature’s refusal to fund our public schools prevents a generation of Washingtonians from getting a fair shot at success. America will fall behind the rest of the world if we don’t do more to educate the next generation of leaders and innovators. In Pierce County, we have some of the most underfunded schools in the state – and the legislature hasn’t done nearly enough to fix the problem. In the Senate, I’ll stand up and demand that we get our fair share of funding. We need progress on so many other issues as well: transportation to get people to work and goods to market; same pay for same work for women; increasing the minimum wage; and allowing workers to earn sick leave. Instead of bashing the other party, I want to work together to get things done. As an experienced negotiator, I’ll reach across the party divide and put an end to politics as usual. If you agree with me, please join this campaign.	 (253) 720-7859; electmeck@gmail.com; www.electmeck.com

Statement Professor David DeWolf is exactly the kind of person we need on the Washington Supreme Court: an expert in our state constitution and Washington’s leading authority on contracts and tort law. His books have been cited by Washington appellate courts over 100 times and are used daily by lawyers and trial judges. This is why he is endorsed by both Democrats and Republicans. For 28 years, Professor DeWolf taught thousands of students at Gonzaga Law School, instilling his love of the law and his respect for the constitution. He is often asked to testify on the constitution and the proper balance of power between judges and our legislators. The current crisis in the court proves we need a thoughtful and reasonable scholar to add much-needed restraint to a court that has become adversarial rather than respectful toward other judges and our elected lawmakers. “Olympia has more than enough politicians,” says DeWolf, “we need judges who will do their job—no more and no less.” David and his wife Priscilla live in Spokane – he’d be only the second member of the court from Eastern Washington.

Founder of a non-profit advocating for transparent government and smart land use planning; public school volunteer teaching science, gardening, art, and architecture; PTA Golden Acorn Awardee.	 Washington has been my home for 30 years and Whidbey Island for 20, where my husband, a retired Naval Aviator, and I built our home and raised our two children. While volunteering to protect a public estuary, I discovered a gross abuse of public funds and began attending local government meetings. What I witnessed compelled me to fight for government that represents people. I became a commissioner when Island County was facing financial collapse. Working with bipartisan colleagues, we cut spending by 20%, streamlined departments, and froze elected official’s salaries. I prioritized living wage jobs, veterans services, affordable housing, public health and safety, water quality, and protecting the environment. To support parks, senior services and 4H, I donated over $40,000 of my salary. It’s time to replace politicians who spend your tax dollars on lobbyists, big corporations, and special interests. I will fight to bring our taxes home to fund education, promote Washington businesses, protect family farms, prioritize jobgenerating road, bridge, and ferry projects, and support a high quality of life. I will listen to, hear, and represent the people in our district. Together we can accomplish great things for today and tomorrow’s generations. I ask for your vote.

I have also worked on economic measures to provide good paying jobs in the future. For example, transferring the Northern State Hospital site to the Port of Skagit, and allowing Arlington and Marysville to create a tax incentive for businesses to locate within their industrial lands. I will always fight to protect victims of crime through legislation. This includes legislation to increase penalties and supervision for domestic violence offenders and strengthening luring statutes, which protect our developmentally disabled and youth.

His books have been cited by Washington appellate courts over 100 times and are used daily by lawyers and trial judges. This is why he is endorsed by both Democrats and Republicans. For 28 years, Professor DeWolf taught thousands of students at Gonzaga Law School, instilling his love of the law and his respect for the constitution. He is often asked to testify on the constitution and the proper balance of power between judges and our legislators. The current crisis in the court proves we need a thoughtful and reasonable scholar to add much-needed restraint to a court that has become adversarial rather than respectful toward other judges and our elected lawmakers. “Olympia has more than enough politicians,” says DeWolf, “we need judges who will do their job—no more and no less.” David and his wife Priscilla live in Spokane – he’d be only the second member of the court from Eastern Washington.

Less than 30 years later our state budget is over $37 billion. that is an average increase of 14% per year. We do not have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem. Our state government has gone far beyond its core functions of educating our children, providing protection for its citizens and caring for our most vulnerable.

As a PTA leader and Mom of children in public school, I understand the challenges our families face. As a tech employee stuck in traffic on our congested roads, I experience the same frustrations that commuters across our region do. Olympia must do better, and I will make sure your voices are heard. Education must take center stage in our budget and policy discussions. I’ll build on the Senate’s record investments in our schools by funding education first, not last. The concerns of drivers will also be my priority; I believe commuters deserve real solutions to flawed tolling programs, and accountability from government agencies. And when it comes to taxes, I’ll make sure families keep as much of their hardearned income as possible. I am deeply rooted in my community. I grew up here, and my husband and I are raising our family in Bothell. As both a long time tech employee and community leader, I know our region must do more to give our students opportunities for great jobs in Washington. I would be honored to earn your vote.

Small business owner of Roscoe’s Ranch, a socially conscious dog boarding facility in Maltby. Manager at Amazon.com leading cross-functional technology projects.

Our region is struggling to manage rapid population growth, traffic, middle class affordability and public school funding. Our district only received a tiny fraction of the state’s $16 billion transportation package despite overwhelming gridlock on our local roads. Our schools are forced to continually raise levies because of chronic underfunding and partisan gridlock in Olympia. From Finn Hill to Snohomish, from Mountlake Terrace to Bothell, our families and small businesses are bearing the burden of legislative inaction and status quo politics. We need more effective leadership from legislators to address the education and infrastructure needs of our district. We need a responsible change in Olympia. I bring a proven community service record and a unique balance of public and private sector experience to more effectively invest in our district’s schools, roads and quality of life. We need a progressive voice for small businesses, teacher support, quality nursing services for seniors, tax exemption reform, environmental stewardship, accountable state budgets and support for mental health, the homeless and the least fortunate among us.

And businesses are leaving our state. Do our voices matter? Let’s remove tolls from I-405 and publicly discuss other options for traffic management.

Washington has been my home for 30 years and Whidbey Island for 20, where my husband, a retired Naval Aviator, and I built our home and raised our two children. While volunteering to protect a public estuary, I discovered a gross abuse of public funds and began attending local government meetings. What I witnessed compelled me to fight for government that represents people. I became a commissioner when Island County was facing financial collapse. Working with bipartisan colleagues, we cut spending by 20%, streamlined departments, and froze elected official’s salaries. I prioritized living wage jobs, veterans services, affordable housing, public health and safety, water quality, and protecting the environment. To support parks, senior services and 4H, I donated over $40,000 of my salary. It’s time to replace politicians who spend your tax dollars on lobbyists, big corporations, and special interests. I will fight to bring our taxes home to fund education, promote Washington businesses, protect family farms, prioritize jobgenerating road, bridge, and ferry projects, and support a high quality of life. I will listen to, hear, and represent the people in our district. Together we can accomplish great things for today and tomorrow’s generations. I ask for your vote.

I believe in ideals that made this country exceptional: limited government, balanced budgets, private property rights, personal control in health care, quality education, strong transportation infrastructure, and the principle that government serves the people -- people don’t serve the government.

That means improving government services, a simpler tax structure with low taxes, reducing costs of workers compensation and unemployment insurance, cutting excessive regulations, and fostering private-sector job creation.

In the State Senate, I’ve worked hard to get results: protecting our individual rights and working with legislators from both parties for practical solutions. I haven’t missed a vote in six years. We increased school funding without raising taxes, lowered college tuition, and made strong investments in transportation. I wrote a law to crack down on red light cameras that were set to trap motorists into paying big fines. As Health Care Committee Chair, the patient is my number one priority. My telemedicine legislation was signed into law, to help bring the expertise of world-class specialists to rural areas and small towns.

A new common ground is emerging between the populist left and right. While there are many issues that divide each side, there are many issues that unite each side.

I stand for common ground, and believe that representatives should put people before party. As such I will bring a new and fresh perspective to the capitol, where true win-win solutions are sought rather than seeking backdoor deals in the political sausage making that is so common today. I believe that the people should be included rather than excluded from weighing in and be able help formulate policy. Transparency and access to data are the cornerstones of that process.

Since I was elected in 2014, I have been able to help thousands of people in our district work through tough issues and get results. I am asking for your vote to continue the work we started.
