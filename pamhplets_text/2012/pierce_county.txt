Message from the Auditor Message from the Auditor
Dear Voter,
2012 is a big year. Pierce County voters are on the front stage, on the front page, and more important
than ever.
More representation.
Pierce County’s representation has increased.
We’ve grown from seven to eight legislative districts: four in whole (25, 27, 28, and 29) and four in part
(2, 26, 30, and 31). And, Pierce County has increased its Congressional Districts from three to four (6, 8, 9,
and 10). The new 10th Congressional District will be decided by Pierce County voters, who make up 57%
of this hotly contested open seat.
Leave the driving to us.
As a result of the 2010 Census and 2012 State Redistricting, boundaries have shifted. While Pierce County may collectively have more districts than before, each voter is assigned only one Congressional District
and only one Legislative District. And, that district may have changed!
Wonder who you’re eligible to vote for?
Relax. Like Greyhound says, “Leave the driving to us.” We have already assigned the new districts to
your personal voter registration profile. As always, we’ll automatically send a ballot to your home with
all of the measures and candidates that you’re eligible to vote on.
State vacancies.
We see an unusual amount of competition on this season’s ballot, as 2012 statewide offices have a high
number of vacancies. Vacancies create real contests and attract new talent. This is where voters can
make a real impact on the future of politics.
Be sure to check out the candidates for the offices of Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, and
State Auditor.
Pierce County Voters’ Pamphlet
This year, the State won’t publish a primary voters’ pamphlet. But, I know how important these races are
to you. So, Pierce County has included all of the candidates in our Local Voters’ Pamphlet.
I know that you take your civic duty seriously. You do your homework. That’s why the Pierce County
Auditor’s Office puts so much effort into producing an excellent Voters’ Pamphlet, delivered to your door.
Wear your “I Voted” sticker proudly (it’s inside this Voters’ Pamphlet), to remind your neighbors of their
civic duty, and to celebrate the historic 2012 election year.
As always, please don’t hesitate to call me. I’d love to hear from you.

Top 2 Primary
What is a Top 2 Primary?
•	 Voters do not have to declare a party affiliation to vote in the primary.
•	 The Washington Top 2 Primary allows voters to choose among all candidates running for
 each office.
•	 Candidates for partisan office may state a preference for a political party, which is listed on
 the ballot.
•	 The two candidates receiving the most votes in the Primary Election qualify for the General
 Election.
•	 Candidates must also receive at least 1% of the votes cast in that race to advance to the
 General Election.
What does the candidate’s “party preference” mean in a Top 2 Primary?
•	 Each candidate for partisan office may state a political party that he or she prefers.
•	 A candidate’s preference does not imply that the candidate is nominated or endorsed by
 the party, or that the party approves of or associates with that candidate.
How did the Top 2 Primary become law?
•	 The Top 2 Primary was passed by the people in 2004 as an initiative. I-872 passed by
 almost 60%.
•	 This system was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in March 2008 and used for the first
 time in the 2008 primary.
•	 It has been in effect for all partisan elections since 2008.
Could a race in the General Election include two candidates who prefer the same party?
•	 Yes. The candidates in each race who advance to the General Election will be the two who
 receive the most votes in the Primary.
•	 Both candidates who advance to the General Election could prefer the same party.

Vote-By-Mail Ballot Secrecy
Is my vote secret?
Yes. Secrecy of the ballot is mandated by Washington State law and is upheld in all elections.
Can my ballot be tracked to me?
No. Election officials can’t trace a ballot back to a particular voter.
How does my ballot remain anonymous?
1. Voter places the voted ballot in the inner secrecy envelope.
2. Voter places the secrecy envelope in the outer return envelope.
3. Voter signs the outer return envelope and drops off at a deposit site (page 4) or
 puts a first class stamp on it and mails back to the Pierce County Auditor's Office.
4. The voter’s signature on the outer return envelope is verified, the outer return
envelope that contains the voter’s name and address is opened and separated from the
inner secrecy envelope that contains the voted ballot.
5. Before the inner secrecy envelope is opened, it is mixed in with many other secrecy
envelopes.
6. Only once the secrecy envelope is mixed in with other secrecy envelopes may the ballot
be removed. This maintains the secrecy of the ballot.
Is this process observed by any outsiders?
In every county, including Pierce County, political party observers are invited to observe the
entire election process. Pierce County has a public viewing area that allows any member of the
public to observe ballot processing.

United States Senator
Michael Baumgartner
(Prefers Republican Party)
Elected Experience: Washington State Senator, 2010 – present
Other Professional Experience: Mike was an economic development consultant and former diplomat who advised
international and Northwest firms. In 2007 Mike served as an Economics Officer at the US Embassy in Baghdad,
earning commendations from General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker. In 2009 he worked on a State Department-contracted counternarcotics program in Afghanistan, helping farmers grow wheat.
Education: Gonzaga Prep, Pullman High; WSU – BA, Economics (1999); Harvard – MPA, International Development
(2002).
Community Service: Mike served as a Jesuit volunteer in Mozambique in 1999. He is a member of the Knights of
Columbus.
Statement: Michael Baumgartner left a successful career in international development to help his country in Iraq
and Afghanistan. Then, he challenged and defeated an entrenched incumbent and won election to the State Senate.
As a State Senator, Michael has shown he can work with both parties to find pragmatic solutions, balance budgets,
reform government spending and improve education. He sponsored legislation to protect higher education funding
and prevent further cutbacks.
Michael has the background, experience, and common sense necessary to be an outstanding U.S. Senator. He is
endorsed by Senator Slade Gorton, Attorney General Rob McKenna, Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers,
Secretary of State Sam Reed, and Representative Cary Condotta. More important, Michael is supported by hundreds of Washington small business owners, veterans, and educators. Michael and his wife Eleanor have a young
son, Conrad, and are expecting another child this year.
“I love Washington. I was born and raised here, the son of two educators. After studying at WSU and Harvard,
my economic development career took me around the world. Washington’s wonderful, natural environment and
friendly, innovative people make it the best place in the world.
“Now, America is struggling. In the past 12 years, reckless spending and poorly planned wars have helped double
the national debt and millions don’t have jobs. Too many politicians care more about special interests than finding
solutions. The US Senate hasn't passed a budget in more than three years. DC is broken.
“I want to help turn things around, here and overseas. I’ve seen firsthand the progress our troops have made in
Afghanistan against amazing odds. Now it's time to bring them home and concentrate on rebuilding our economy.
Our children should inherit a thriving America - not one in debt and decline. I'd be honored to have your vote.
We’ve got work to do.”

United States Senator
Will Baker
(Prefers Reform Party)
continued
Elected Experience: No information submitted
Other Professional Experience: No information submitted
Education: No information submitted
Community Service: As a direct result of Will's community service, Will believes the number one issue in the 2012
U.S. Senate election should be the illegal and unethical election practices used by Washington Secretary of State
Sam Reed. Fact: Secretary of State Reed is in the business of manipulating State primary elections. How? Fact: One
way is to illegally and/or unethically manipulate/rig information available to voters. How? Fact: Reed cancelled the
entire 2010 and 2012 printed Washington State Primary Voters' Pamphlets and continues to hide information about
how to appear in some counties local Voters' Pamphlet from some candidates.
Statement: I believe the number one issue in the 2012 U.S. Senate election should be impeaching President Barack
Obama specifically for Obama’s decision to give America’s state of art military spy drone technology to Iran (and
through Iran to China and Russia).
The 1979 Iranian Revolution; Fact: America backed the Shah of Iran. Fact: The Shah was a ruthless dictator who
murdered his people. Fact: The Iranians revolted against the Shah. Fact:. The Iranians hated America for supporting the Shah. Fact: The Iranians took American hostages. Fact: In 1979, President Jimmy Carter ordered a raid to
rescue the hostages, but the operation failed when the Delta Force’s helicopter crashed. 9/11 Terrorist Attack
Fact: On September 11, 2001, 19 al-Qaeda members on a suicide mission hijacked four airplanes and flew three of
those planes into the world trade center towers and the Pentagon; killing thousands of Americans. Fact: The leader
of al-Qaeda was Osama bin Laden. Mr. Commander In Chief
Fact: In November 2008, Obama was elected President and Commander in Chief. Bye-bye Bin Laden Fact: In 2011,
Obama ordered the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Fact: Obama ordered the special operations commander who
organized the bin Laden raid to throw in two additional helicopters for backup. (Good decision, since one of the assault helicopters crashed outside bin Laden’s compound.)
Fact: Seal Team Six destroyed the damaged helicopter before leaving Pakistan. Fact: Now, Iran wants a nuclear
weapon.
Fact: Obama’s administration has been flying stealth spy drones over Iran to monitor Iran’s nuclear program. Fact:
One of the drones crashed in Iran. Fact: Obama didn’t send military personnel into Iran to retrieve the drone, and
didn’t blow-up the drone by remote before Iran grabbed it. Fact: Now Iran has our stealth spy drone and they are
not giving it back.

Chuck Jackson
(Prefers Republican Party)

Elected Experience: Never elected to public office
Other Professional Experience: Merchant Mariner, been working on ships for over 30 years, Alaska and Washington
ferries, tankers hauling crude oil out of Alaska, Container ships to Hawaii and the Far East, Licensed United State
Coast Guard Engineer, work out of the MEBA hall, spent 4 years in the Navy.
Education: University of H.K.; Hawse-piper
Community Service: No information submitted
Statement: The kids and grandkids inheritance $15,700,000,000,000 ($15.7 trillion)DEBT. When the incumbent first
went to Washington D.C. the National Debt was $4,188,092,106,183. Over the last 30 years the people of the United
States have paid $9,500,000,000,000 (9.5 trillion) interest (usury) on this Debt; last year $454,000,000,000 was spent
covering interest. When the Federal Reserve Bank doubles the interest rates, payment will double from $454 Billion
to $908 Billion.
We have a serious problem; the postponement of dealing with this over the years has left the United States in a
precarious financial situation. I don't have a SuperPac or millions of dollars; just Voters pamphlets, website and
hopefully your involvement, (facebook, twitter, dialog with friends and neighbors) the only possible way to stop this
train-wreck.
"As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public credit. One method of preserving it is, to use it
as sparingly as possible..." President Washington
Potholes, bridges and other infrastructure could have been repaired had the public credit been cherished instead of
squandered.
"I place economy among the first and most important virtues, and public debt as the greatest of dangers to be
feared. To preserve our independence, we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. If we run into such
debt, we must be taxed in our meat and drink, in our necessities and in our comforts, in our labor and in our amusements. If we can prevent the government from wasting the labor of the people, under the pretense of caring for
them, they will be happy," President Jefferson
We, the borrowers, are slaves to the lenders; austerity measures that will be forced on U.S. will pale in comparison
to what has been forced on Greece, if this financial mess continues.

United States Senator
Art Coday
(Prefers Republican Party)
continued
Elected Experience: None
Other Professional Experience: Art spent six years in biochemical and heart research. As a medical doctor he does
house calls and nursing home care, mainly for Medicare (seniors, permanently disabled), Medicaid (very poor),
and uninsured patients.
Education: Art graduated from the Lakeside School, the University of Washington (B.S. in Cellular and Molecular
Biology; with college honors, magna cum laude), and Harvard Medical School (M.D.).
Community Service: Art volunteered at the Seattle Children’s Hospital Summer Camp for six years, working with
children with special medical needs. He served on nonprofit boards, including three years for the North Seattle
Christian School, as Treasurer and President.
Statement: As a doctor, I fight for my patients. As your senator, I will fight for you.
Patient financial hardship and insurance status do not stop me from caring. To accept low reimbursements, I
reduced cost by eliminating my office; now I make house calls. Effective healthcare reform is needed, so let’s
repeal the healthcare act my opponent supported; it harms Medicare and Medicaid and raises cost. Let’s rebuild
Medicare, Medicaid, and the VHA for our seniors, poor, disabled, and veterans. In the private market, let’s demand
transparency, fairness, and competition so you’re in charge of affordable care.
Cutting spending, balancing the budget, reducing debt, and ending inflation will repair our national credit and
stabilize the economy. As a small business owner, I know that easing regulatory burdens and mandates, enacting
favorable trade policies, and lowering energy costs will stimulate the economy. This will restore the catastrophic
loss of prosperity and American jobs sustained throughout my opponent’s 12-year tenure.
I will defend your rights, including your right to keep and bear arms, the right to life, and property rights. I support
traditional family values. We must maintain the world’s finest military to achieve peace through strength. We must
take good care of our veterans and military personnel, and have a foreign policy that’s confidently pro-America
and pro-liberty, supports allies like Israel, and is firmly resolved to defeat terrorism. Border security is vital. My opponent won’t challenge her party boss on numerous issues, like transferring nuclear waste from Hanford to Yucca
Mountain; I will.
The contrast between the incumbent and me is sharp; the record, not the rhetoric, proves this. I am passionate
about America, and with the right leadership, our children will have a bright future.
Thank you for your trust and your vote. Serving you will be an honor.

United States Senator
Maria Cantwell
(Prefers Democratic Party)
Elected Experience: U.S. Senate 2001-Present, U.S. House of Representatives 1993-1995, Washington State Legislature 1987-1993
Other Professional Experience: Real Networks, Vice President of Marketing & Senior Vice President of the Consumer
Products Division 1995-2000
Education: B.A. in Public Administration from Miami University
Community Service: Henry M. Jackson Foundation, Honorary Council of Advisors; South Snohomish Chamber of
Commerce, Former Board Member; Mountlake Terrace Friends of the Library; Alderwood Rotary, Former Board
Member; Apollo Alliance, Founding Board Member
Statement: Congress is bogged down in partisanship and gridlock. But Senator Maria Cantwell puts politics aside
and does what’s right for our state. Maria is focused on job creation and keeping America competitive in the global
economy - because she knows too many families are struggling just to get by.
That’s why Maria is working to make sure Washington State remains the hub of America’s aerospace industry. She
fought unfair foreign competition to help Boeing win the $35 billion Air Force contract that could mean 11,000 jobs
for our state. Now Maria is helping develop apprenticeship and job training programs so we have a skilled workforce for those jobs.
Maria’s fighting to increase Pell Grants and help middle class kids afford college. She co-sponsored a bill giving
returning veterans access to a college education. She’s working to give laid-off workers and veterans access to job
training at community colleges so they can develop the skills they need for new jobs.
To create opportunities for businesses to hire more workers, Maria voted to cut taxes for small businesses and
manufacturers while pushing banks to loan to small businesses that want to grow. Maria recognizes that the federal
deficit is a dagger pointed at the heart of our economy, so she’s working to cut wasteful government spending. She
is pushing to end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and instead provide tax incentives for companies
that create jobs here. And Maria is working to develop Washington’s new clean energy industry, which will create
thousands of jobs across our state.
Maria kept her commitment to protect Social Security and Medicare, fighting attempts by both parties to cut these
vital programs.
Senator Maria Cantwell is focused on making life better for our families and for the people of Washington State.

Other Professional Experience: I am currently writing two books. One on National Energy policy and the other on the
Political breakdown our country is currently experiencing.
Education: I graduated from American River College in General Education.
Community Service: No information submitted
Statement: Our political system is broken. Polls from earlier this year showed Congress with a historically low 10%
(8% among Independents) approval rating. Meanwhile, there is a growing unease in our Nation. An undercurrent of
fear that something has gone, Is going, terribly wrong. That the future is not as bright for our children as it was for
previous generations. This fear is well founded and the breakdown in our political system is only the latest symptom.
At this point Voting for either a Democrat or a Republican is not going to Fix the breakdown in Washington. Ask
yourself, has it previously? It is not too late to fix what ails this country. There are vast untapped resources among
our population. We are still a wealthy Nation even if it doesn’t feel like it at the moment. If we are going to change
Congress, and thereby the direction of the Nation, than we need to elect Independent voices that are not part of
either political machine.
My goals if elected would be to focus on repairing our local infrastructure and improving the education of our Nations children.
Some of my political beliefs: I believe in helping people reach for a better life while Not creating dependancies. I
believe Women have the right to make their own decisions on their healthcare and the State has no business interfering. The only exception would be for Abortion. I think abortion should be legal but only up to 20 weeks. I believe
that Education is the most Important task we have as a society. I believe we need to increase and sustain our spending on the Nations Infrastructure.

U.S. Representative, 6th Congressional District
Elected Experience: State Senator: 2007-present; State Representative: 2005-2006; Department of Veterans' Affairs
Legislator of the Year; Washington Economic Development Association LEADER Award; Washington Council of
Police and Sheriffs Legislator of the Year
Other Professional Experience: Vice President, Economic Development Board for Tacoma-Pierce County; Former
Management Consultant, McKinsey & Company
Education: Diploma, Port Angeles High School; Bachelors' Degree, Princeton University; Doctoral Degree, University
Of Oxford
Community Service: Former Trustee, Tacoma Community College; Board Member, Gig Harbor-Peninsula Area
Chamber of Commerce; Member, Bremerton and Port Orchard Chambers of Commerce; Board Member, Peninsula
Schools Education Foundation; Member, Gig Harbor Rotary; Member, Gig Harbor United Methodist Church
Statement: I understand the challenges people are facing because I've lived them.
I was born and raised on the Olympic Peninsula. I saw my friends' parents lose jobs when the timber industry
declined. That's why I work in economic development. My mom immigrated to America with nothing. She and Dad
were teachers, and Dad still teaches beyond retirement age. I afforded college through loans and scholarships, and
the future of my two daughters depends on strong public schools. My 102-year-old grandmother relies on Social
Security and Medicare.
My day job is focused on helping local businesses thrive. I've met with hundreds of employers who say Congress is
missing the boat on creating jobs. Keeping taxes low is important - which is why I voted against general tax increases as State Senator - but businesses also need skilled employees, better infrastructure like roads and sewers, and a
friendlier business climate. On Main Street, at the port, in the woods, and at the shipyard, I'll fight to keep and grow
jobs here.
I'm the only candidate with a record of working with both parties to deliver for the middle class: 1) balancing our
state budget and reducing our debt, unlike Washington D.C.; 2) using my experience as a business consultant to
make government more efficient and keep Narrows Bridge costs down; 3) facilitating construction of a new regional
hospital that created 450 jobs and saved lives; 4) helping veterans and their families find civilian employment and
grow their businesses.
I'm proudly endorsed by Norm Dicks because he understands our next Congressman needs to focus on keeping and
growing local jobs, supporting our veterans, balancing the budget while protecting seniors, and ensuring a clean
Puget Sound.
It's time to get people back to work. It's time for Congress to get back to work too.

Elected Experience: No information submitted
Other Professional Experience: U.S. Marine Corps Major, infantry officer and civil affairs team leader
Leader in the forest products field, including working for Weyerhaeuser in three divisions over much of his career.
He has substantial experience exporting U.S. goods to Asia.
Education: BA in Economics from Bates College in Lewiston Maine; MBA in Management from Northwestern University; Graduated from U.S. Army Ranger School and U.S. Army Airborne School
Community Service: Bill and his wife Lisa are active in our community, volunteering with the Broadway Center,
the Asia Pacific Cultural Center, the Tacoma Art Museum, the Metro Parks Foundation and the Tacoma Children’s
Museum.
Statement: Bill Driscoll is running for Congress because the career politicians have failed to solve America’s problems. Bill’s not a politician. He’s Marine Corps veteran, a leader in the forest products field and a fiscal conservative.
18 years after leaving the Marine Corps, Bill volunteered to be recommissioned, serving combat tours in Iraq and
Afghanistan. He volunteered because he saw the toll that repeated long deployments were taking on the men and
women of our armed forces and he knew he could help. Every American sees the toll the national debt, partisan
gridlock and the great recession are taking on our country. The same commitment to serve that led Bill to rejoin the
Marines motivates him to serve in Congress. Bill has three priorities:
Jobs, the Economy and Schools. Jobs are created by people, not government. The current administration’s fixation
on big government solutions to the economy has failed. Bill believes that the best thing government can do for the
economy is provide innovative and successful public schools.
Veterans and a Strong National Defense. Bill understands the importance of our military and will protect services
to veterans and military families. He will ensure that America’s armed forces remain strong, and able to defend our
country from any threat.
Balancing the Federal Budget. Nothing poses a greater threat to our country than the failure of both parties to balance the federal budget and address the mounting national debt. This challenge will require non-politicians like Bill,
who are able to work across party lines.
Bill and his wife Lisa live in Tacoma. They have two children, John Saul and Anna. Lisa is a professor at UW Tacoma. Bill enjoys reading history and hiking. For the first time in a generation we can have a fresh start in Congress.
We can elect Bill Driscoll.

(Prefers Republican Party)
Elected Experience: None
Other Professional Experience: U.S. Navy – SSBN-634(Gold Crew), Nuclear Engineer, Strategic Weapons Officer, Certified Public Accountant (CPA), Technology Consultant, Programmer, founder and CEO of ICAN Software Corporation
Education: B.A. Business Administration (University of Washington), B.S. Accounting (Central Washington University), Naval Nuclear Power School, and lots of continuing education in the fields of accounting and technology over
the years.
Community Service: Congregational elder and worship leader, prison/jail ministries, homeless ministry, service on
boards of several not-for-profit organizations in Kitsap County. Volunteer speaking engagements at accounting and
technology events around the country.
Statement: Years of experience in engineering, aquaculture, municipal government, accounting, and technology
industries have prepared me to represent the diverse interests of our region. As a Navy veteran with submarine and
shipyard experience, I’d have the most credibility discussing Keyport, Submarine Base Bangor, and the Naval Shipyard with Navy leadership.
Job growth requires less government, more liberty, strong property rights and a stable tax environment that is
competitive with that of other nations. Our households have had to adjust their spending levels…so can the federal
government.
The federal government currently borrows 40% of what it spends. Interest payments are almost 10% of the federal
budget at today’s low rates. If rates rise to normal historical rates, interest payments will bankrupt the federal government. Bankrupt governments historically raise taxes on everyone, seize or destroy savings, and cause jobs to
quickly disappear.
We can change the course of our nation by balancing the budget in years rather than decades, and we can do so
while honoring our commitments to the elderly and veterans.
To that end, we can’t afford to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign aid and maintain so many military
bases around the world. Other nations must take responsibility for their own military needs. When we subsidize their
defense, their economies lure more American jobs overseas. We must spend our defense dollars smarter on local
bases here at home where it benefits our economy, not theirs. Let’s bring our heroes home to their families… and
bring back jobs.
I’ll work to restore our Founding Fathers’ vision of a nation of self-rule and limited government, a nation of peace
and commerce, and a constitutional republic with a stable currency where individual liberties are protected. I humbly offer my time and talents to represent you honestly and honorably in Congress.

Other Professional Experience: Boeing Manufacturing Engineer, Small Business Owner/Mechanic Import Auto
works, Real Estate Investor, Worldwide Aviator, Air Force Reserve Flight Engineer, Aircraft Technician. Served on
Active Duty, Air National Guard and Reserves 1978 to 2006
Education: Graduate Longmont High School, Colorado; Colorado State University B.S. Industrial Science; Community College of the Air Force; Associates Aircraft Maintenance Technology, Associates Aviation Operations, FAA Flight
Engineer Turbo Jet powered license, FAA A&P License, 2 years vocational automotive school
Community Service: Significant investment in Fernhill Business District; Performed DOD Alaska/Washington/California Air Evacuation mission for 5 years; Performed Iraq Air Evacuation mission for 18 months
Statement: From New Amsterdam to Afghanistan, Brodhead’s have fought for freedom and the American Dream.
We stood with George Washington at Valley Forge. We stood with Abraham Lincoln at Appomattox. We fought in
Mexico alongside Franklin Pierce and helped pass legislation that connected Manifest Destiny. We served this country throughout the Cold War, Vietnam, and Iraq.
At no time in our history have so many things converged at once on our American way of life. Over the next two
decades, 3.6 million Baby Boomers will retire each year for full ride entitlements at a ratio of 2.5 workers to one
recipient. Medicare and Medicaid costs will double, and then quadruple in short order. The current tax and entitlement structure is unsustainable. Americans will have to find solutions to serial $1.6 trillion annual deficits, quantitative easing 10% of GDP, printing money out of thin air, and borrowing 40 cents of every Federal dollar spent. We
will have to deal with the Federal government’s penchant for spending our Social Security Surplus, borrowing from
China to honor Social Security IOUs, and then slipping the bill to our children. We will have to deal with International currency devaluation, one sided trade deals, and job losses due to offshoring. We have much to do.
Here are a few things that I would like to do to help right our course: Birth Right Citizenship Bill, raise Social Security
payroll taxation from 6.2 to 7.5%, Hands off our Social Security Amendment, Reform Medicare cost sharing structure, Medicaid block grants, Education block grants, increase the military budget to 4% of GDP and retool America’s
air, land, sea, and space assets. Reduce our dependency on foreign oil by supporting new battery technologies and
infrastructure etc. Reduce Federal government non mandatory spending to 2008 levels. That’s just a start….

Doug Cloud
(Prefers Republican Party)
Elected Experience: No information submitted
Other Professional Experience: I have served as a deputy prosecutor in Kitsap County and an assistant deputy
prosecutor in Pierce County. I have owned and operated a private law office in Tacoma for the past 20 years. As a
lawyer, I have represented many people throughout the 6th District and have successfully represented my clients in
some of the highest courts in the country.
Education: I received my BA in economics from the University of Washington in 1980. I received my law degree,
also from the University of Washington, in 1983.
Community Service: I have coached youth sports for the Peninsula Athletic Association.
Statement: I am running for Congress because the Federal Government stands in the way of the American Dream.
Our economic difficulties are a direct result of policies adopted by Congress and the President. They continue to
steal the ambitious spirit and freedom of our people through bailouts, stimulus and special favors which continue to
pile on dangerous amounts of debt.
Our happiness and prosperity are in jeopardy, but this is not an unalterable course. America is the greatest country
on earth and needs more leaders who can handle a fiscal fight. Rewarding Washington insiders and the well connected is not the American way. I oppose bailouts because they hurt the economy and infringe on our freedom. We
cannot spend or regulate our way into prosperity.
At a young age, I learned the value of hard work and self-reliance. I grew up in Fife and graduated from Fife High
School. As a young man I owned my own recycling business. I worked as a farm laborer, a factory worker and at a
lumberyard prior to graduating from high school. In college I was elected a union shop steward. These experiences
gave me the confidence I needed to succeed and strengthened my belief in the free market system.
As your congressman, I will take this entrepreneurial spirit to Washington and will work to ensure that future generations have the same opportunities to achieve their dreams as did the ones before them. I will make sure we keep
our promises to those that serve in the military, including declaring wars constitutionally. I will also work to ensure
we keep our promises to our seniors. It’s time to restore constitutional and fiscal responsibility in Congress.
My campaign has been endorsed by the Republican Liberty Caucus, Clint Didier and State Representative Matt
Shea, among many others.

Elected Experience: King County Sheriff, 1998-2005; US House of Representatives, 2005-Current
Other Professional Experience: Dave served in the US Air Force Reserve (1971-1976). He joined the King County
Sheriff’s Office in 1972 and in 1998 became King County’s first elected sheriff in 30 years.
Education: Concordia Lutheran College, AA
Community Service: Served on King County’s Domestic Violence Council. Board of Directors for Special Olympics of
Washington. Co-Chair of King County Methamphetamine Coalition. Former Member of King County Committee to
End Homelessness. Co-Founder of King County Sheriff's Police Activities League. Youth coach and counselor. Two
time Washington Medal of Valor Recipient. National Sheriff of the Year.
Statement: Leadership. As a public servant, my energy is focused on spurring our economy, ensuring our children
have access to good schools, protecting our freedom to choose doctors, and defending the vulnerable. Too many
families are suffering, finding their hope and budgets strained. Too often, government regulations and bloated
budgets have held back the private sector. I will continue working to reform our tax code, cut spending, and reduce
regulations in an effort to enhance private sector innovation.
Integrity. Character and integrity make us who we are. In tough times, it becomes all too easy to serve personal interests, forget the needs of neighbors, and toss integrity aside. I have always served our community, our state, and
our nation with an optimistic spirit. I believe our best days are ahead, and America will continue to be the greatest
nation, because we never surrender and we always pull together. We are free and must fight to remain free for our
children and grandchildren.
Service. From the first day I put on my Air Force uniform until today, I have committed myself to service. While a
sheriff’s deputy, I saw the most humbling acts of service and selfless sacrifices. I have a servant’s heart and want to
make America even better for the next generation. Every day, I hope to earn your trust by serving with honesty and
representing you with integrity.
Teamwork. I’m a pragmatic leader, believing it’s more important to solve problems than claim credit or be trapped
in partisanship. Whether running a small business, nursing the sick, tending an orchard, raising a family, or serving
in the military, everyone wonders why our problems persist. With leadership founded on integrity, humble service,
and teamwork, we will put these tough days behind us and turn our energy toward the next opportunities.

Education: Graduated Everett Area High School, Everett, PA; B.S. Psychology, University of Washington; Washington State Police Academy, Army Airborne School, Ranger School, and seminars relating to social issues and interpersonal skills.
Community Service: Keith has been serving his community his entire adult life, either as a soldier or as a police officer. Keith has received several leadership awards. Keith is a past member of the Fraternal Order of Eagles. He has
also helped coach Little League and junior wrestling.
Statement: Keith is running for Congress because government spending is out of control, the United States Constitution is being undermined, our borders are not secure, and our dependence on foreign energy compromises
foreign policy issues.
Keith is a Christian, social conservative, and pro-life advocate. Keith is married and has four children. His oldest son
is a cadet at West Point.
Keith supports a limited government that derives its powers from the people based on a system of laws that must
be obeyed by elected officials. He maintains that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to possess
firearms and to use those arms for lawful purposes. Keith is an avid outdoorsman, spending several weeks afield
every year.
Keith believes that this country needs to act in a fiscally conservative manner and say “No” to spending, “No” to
debt ceiling increases, “No” to bailouts, and “No” to ‘cap and trade’ type legislation. Keith believes in protecting citizens’ rights. He also believes that now is the time for people to elect Congressmen who have the courage to enact
legislation that will close our borders to illegal immigration, allow for the immediate drilling and mining of energy
resources in our own country, and retain a military force that can adequately protect the American people.
Keith is a man of honor and integrity who will not be intimidated or coerced. He has the courage to stand up and
do the right thing. Keith has shown this courage as a soldier and police officer. He is a leader that others look to for
guidance. Keith’s word is his bond.
This is the year to return America to a country “of, by, and for the people”. A vote for Keith Swank will help insure
that. Thank you. God bless you. God bless America.

Statement: James Windle has the work ethic, courage, and experience to best represent you in Congress. Windle is
a product of the 8th District. Born and raised in Sammamish, he graduated from Redmond High School and worked
for nearly a decade at his family’s gas station on Mercer Island. He grew up as an active outdoorsman in Kittitas and
Chelan counties. After attending Washington State University and the University of Washington as the first college
graduate in his family, Windle pursued a real-world education in government in our nation's Capital. He built a successful public service career working closely with both political parties in the White House budget office, Congress,
and federal agencies. This unique experience has informed his balanced, clear vision on creating jobs, increasing
economic growth, and making Congress work better for you.
Common-sense solutions that mix the best ideas of both political parties will create the conditions for economic
growth and opportunity. The choice is not to cut or increase government spending. It is to cut inefficiency and reinvest some savings wisely into education, agriculture, science, and infrastructure. The choice is not to raise or cut
taxes. It is a simpler, fairer tax code that reduces everyone’s taxes and closes loopholes that give preferential treatment to those who do not need it. Only an Independent can propose and fight for this platform.
Windle is the candidate with the experience, knowledge, understanding of national and local issues, and vision to
serve the 8th District effectively in Congress. His home in Snoqualmie Pass makes him accessible to voters on both
sides of the Cascades. His time in the federal government will enable him to get you results. Elect Windle for Congress to move our country forward with independent ideas and the courage to act.

Education: Graduate of Rainer Beach High School, BA in Political Science from Western Washington University, Masters of Public Administration from Seattle University.
Community Service: She has volunteered with numerous nonprofits, including Campfire, United Way, Everett Libraries, National Grantmakers Forum, TIPS, and The Salvation Army.
Statement: The influence of special interests on politics has resulted in a system that does not work for us, it works
for special interests. Karen Porterfield has pledged not to take money from special interests so she can focus on
doing what is right for the people that elect her. Karen wants to give the voters a true choice between herself and
the incumbent who has taken over $4.3 million in special interest contributions and has supported oil companies, financial institutions and Wall Street. Karen is our best hope to get America back to work, begin reform of Wall Street,
build a world class educational system and invest in a sustainable transportation infrastructure.
She has a history of community service and understands first-hand the needs of our communities. Karen has
worked for the Salvation Army, helped develop affordable housing, managed programs in rural communities and
raised over $300 million to help nonprofits serve our communities. At Seattle University she teaches our future
leaders in the Masters of Public Administration program. Karen believes that the best way to ensure our country’s
greatness is to give back to our community.
We need to restore faith in our government. Porterfield’s goals are to begin work to transform our government and
economy by changing the inequality of our tax structure. She opposes Republicans move to dismantle or privatize
social security and Medicare.
In 2010, the Seattle Times editorialized that the incumbent was “woefully unprepared on issues ranging from wars
to the economy.” In the same year, the incumbent stated that the only reason he voted for environmental bills was
because he needed the support of environmental groups to get reelected.

Keith Arnold
(Prefers Democratic Party)
Elected Experience: I would appreciate the opportunity to serve the public in first elected office.
Other Professional Experience: Proud federal employee, NOAA.
Education: B. S., Accountancy, University of Illinois
Community Service: Baptist. I proposed delaying conversion to dtv in 2009 to Congress. Because to justify allowing
analog televisions' sales, there should be analog reception for the televisions' lifetimes. Proposed Judiciary Act of
1993 to Congress and the President in 1993 to neutralize then eliminate the out-of-control U. S. supreme court (and
its legislating from the bench). I am a previous and current Congressional candidate because I care enough to keep
fighting for America and Americans.
Statement: I will fight for fairness for the 99% plus the 1%. I want to help us all receive fairness. Always be careful of
those trying to confuse or trick you.
Everyone who is law-abiding must be included in our economy and workforce and have a living wage. Our economy is great but it is not sabotage proof. A small greedy part of the 1% must not be allowed to be looters by taking
advantage of do-nothing Congresses and a poorly policed (deregulated) economy and financial markets.
Fairness requires looking at each issue individually and choosing the fair option. For some issues the fair option is
more appealing to the left wing and for other issues the fair option is more appealing to the right wing. It is a mystery why the left and right choose the fair choice for some issues and the unfair choice for others. Although, I believe
the Democrats make the fair choice the most often and on the most important issues, I will make decisions based on
what is fair not on what any political party says.
Fairness includes: government and businesses serving the people (not the reverse); quality schools; fair free global
trade; clean alternative energy sources; supporting our troops and veterans economically and financially; not starting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan or bank bailout; immigration law enforcement focused on abusive employers;
a tax system that is progressive for higher incomes; universal healthcare; Pro-life (exceptions: rape, incest, significant health risk); UN-focused world unity.
We Americans believes in Abraham Lincoln's government of the people by the people for the people. We can't allow
the greedy to continue to turn it into government of the people by the corporation for the corporation.
I would appreciate your vote and the opportunity to fight for fairness for all.

to the poor, the homeless, and nursing home residents. I'm a married fourth generation Washington resident with
eight adult children. I home schooled for ten years. I'm a Christian.
Statement: I've assembled a superb prospective Congressional staff. Bills have already been drafted that I will
introduce to quickly reduce or eliminate most taxes, significantly cut unemployment, end the fraudulent national
debt, maintain entitlements, and rescue our military. We are in dire circumstances. The battle to save our nation will
be long and hard. It will be won, in part, by you supporting and electing me.
Our Constitutional government is being dismantled. Most Congressional incumbents shamefully ignore or cause
it, thereby disqualifying themselves for office. Our survival requires their replacement. The incumbent must not be
reelected.
He voted against oil drilling in Alaska, increasing our gas prices. He voted against development of oil shale areas,
again increasing our gas prices. He lobbied Congress for Obama to pass the Korea Trade Act, which is projected to
cause the loss of 159,000 U.S. jobs.
He, along with four Washington State Democrats and Jesse Jackson, Jr., sponsored the Alpine Lakes Wilderness
Act that would have taken 22,173 acres of private property away from district voters and given their land to the
government. He also voted for the Omnibus Public Land Management Act to take 2 million acres of private property
away from U.S. citizens and give their land to the government.
He voted to repeal Don't Ask Don't Tell, enshrining homosexuals in our military. He voted to allow Obama to indefinitely detain U.S. citizens, without our Constitutional rights, under the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act. He
also voted for Cap and Trade, and TARP.
I would have voted oppositely on all the above, and will vote oppositely on similar legislation. Please go to my

Member, Northeast Tacoma Elementary PTA where my wife, Sara, served as PTA President for 2 years; Member,

Statement: I grew up in the city of SeaTac. My father worked as a ramp serviceman, my mother a homemaker. I
have lived my entire life in the 9th District. My wife Sara and I are now raising our two children, Kendall, and Jack, in
the 9th District where they have attended Tacoma public schools. As a State Senator, Prosecutor, Congressman and
member of our community I have followed the values my parents taught--integrity, hard work, personal responsibility and independence.
Creating jobs and growing our economy is my number one priority. Working class families, like the one I grew up
in, do not have the same opportunities as previous generations. This must change. We need a fairer tax code, better
education and job training opportunities, improved transportation infrastructure, a secure social safety net for our
seniors, and a fair plan to reduce our federal deficit. We need to focus on the fundamentals: more Americans back to
work, better use of our tax dollars and equal opportunity for all.
I have served on the Armed Services Committee for my entire time in Congress and have always worked hard to
make sure that our servicemen, women and their families receive all of the support they need and deserve. I will
continue to do so and also believe that it’s time for us to bring our troops home from Afghanistan as soon as we
responsibly can. We must quickly transition to Afghan control of security.
Right now our country needs leaders who are focused on confronting the challenges we face head on. We cannot
waste time on partisan politics and ideological rhetoric. I am focused on finding solutions, working with all members to solve our common problems. It is an honor to serve this district in Congress, and I ask for your vote.

Statement: Governments worldwide, including the United States, are out-of-control assuming too much risk, spending too much money, interfering with our lives, and damaging our economy, jobs, and businesses. These policies
will not work for us, but politicians know that they can get elected by offering benefits they cannot pay for. We must
repudiate them and return to the constitutional principles that have made this country great. You have a choice to
make in this election. You can vote for more government, more poverty, and more control over your lives; or you
can vote for freedom, dignity of the individual, and prosperity.
My program will save Social Security and Medicare while providing all the promised benefits; restore sound money,
stop inflation which robs the middle class, pay off the national debt, provide full employment and bring back exported jobs and capital. No Bailouts.
We are on our way to becoming self-sufficient in energy. We can produce all the oil and gas that we need and stop
importing oil. This has huge economic benefits including jobs. This economy depends on oil for transportation, land,
air and sea, industry, and agriculture. We need $2.00 gasoline and diesel fuel again.
Our transportation systems are stagnant and have not improved for fifty years. Our roads are in gridlock but underutilized Progress in air and space has stopped. Our automobiles are magnificent but they go no faster. Our airplanes
are stuck at the speed of sound. We went to the moon but have retreated to earth orbit. We can do better.
We need a strong military to protect our nation but do not need undeclared foreign wars which are not in our interest or wartime restrictions on our civil liberties.

will work to rebuild our economy by providing good jobs for working families. I will assist the President in more
progressive legislation investing in education and training, building a stronger middle class!
We must cut middle class taxes to increase consumer spending and jump start the economy. We must create good
paying jobs through investments in education, expanding alternative energy, rebuilding infrastructure and new
technologies and have a fair tax code for all American's and expect the very wealthy to pay a larger share to accomplish the goal of moving America forward in this new century.
Social Security and Medicare must be protected! They have worked for many years! Cuts in Social Security and
Medicare would not only hurt senoirs , but the middle class, the poor, children and grandchildren. Many people
survive on their Social Security, which they paid into approximately forty years! This contract must be honored! We
must have health insurance for all Americans!
We will build a strong federal government job base in our new 9th District. I have always supported our troops and
their needs. The President and I did not support the Iraq War. We must offer a road to citizenship for all hardworking people, the foundation of our country. We need to be united with our ally Israel and their furtherance of peace.

society. We are the hardest working, brightest , creative people in the world and we must come together to restore
and rebuild our communities and our Country! I would be honored to represent our new 9th District.

U.S. Representative, 9th Congressional District
Elected Experience: No information submitted
Other Professional Experience: After being a nonviolent participant in the 1999 WTO protests, I realized the solution
to the economic crisis required a competent policy. I encountered LaRouche's economic theory, and realized the
genius of Franklin Roosevelt. Over the years, I have worked with LaRouche on many fronts: Cheney's impeachment;
stopping Bush's Social Security privatization; ending the wars and police state measures under both Bush and
Obama; organizing for Glass-Steagall to stop the bail out of Wall Street. I'm running on a national slate of LaRouche
Democrats, to restore the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy.
Education: St. John’s University Graduate
Community Service: No information submitted
Statement: “My politics are short and sweet, like the old woman’s dance. I am in favor of a National Bank, the internal improvements system, and a high protective tariff.” -Abraham Lincoln
Since the death of John F. Kennedy, our nation has gone into an accelerated collapse under the policies collectively
known as “globalization”. We have systematically shut down our industrial and manufacturing base, replacing an
economy that was based on scientific and technological advancement, with an economy that is now based on financial speculation and looting undeveloped nations. This was not accidental, however. This was intentional.
“Globalization” is simply an extension of the “free trade” imperial policies of the British East India Company. Today’s similar complex of international banks and multinational cartels, seeks to destroy the sovereignty of nations,
and dictate living standards to the population. This modern day British Empire enforces their rule through endless
wars, police state measures, and “free trade”. These are the policies we have been subjected to under Bush and
Obama, both of whom should have been impeached. The global financial system has now disintegrated, and cannot
be bailed out on the backs of the people. There is a solution. This is my simple platform:
Glass- Steagall: Restore Franklin Roosevelt’s “Banking Act of 1933”. Separate the Wall Street speculative gambling
banks from our commercial banks.
National Banking: The Federal Reserve System is hopelessly bankrupt. We must reestablish Hamilton’s design for
sovereign national banking.
NAWAPA XXI: A Kennedy era project that nearly passed Congress in 1964. It will provide 6 million jobs over 30
years, deliver 138 million acre feet of water per year, and generate 42,000 MW of electricity. This will be a part of
the development of the Arctic region, which will become our “window to space”, a laboratory to make advances in
space exploration.

Community Service: Board of Directors, Lake Washington Technical College Foundation, 1991-203; Vice-President of
the Polish Baseball and Softball Federation, 2004-2010; King County Refugee Planning Committee.
Statement: My name is John Orlinski and I am running for office as an independent Republican who is fiscally conservative and moderate on social issues. I am seeking office because I deeply care about our country and its future.
In this race, I want to represent the silent majority of people who feel that their voices are not being heard by the
bickering extremists on both sides - people whose personal liberties, constitutional rights, and individual freedoms
are under attack.
Our government is out of control with bailouts, stimulus packages, and crony-capitalism grants that have caused
our budget deficits to balloon and increased our national debt by five trillion dollars over the last three years. We
need to reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act and impose other restrictions on the banking system so we can avoid future
crises. Audit and oversight of the Federal Reserve System should be implemented.
Our unemployment levels have remained high since the current recession began. We need to do more in this area
but the majority of our efforts should be concentrated on increasing private employment levels. We need to show
more financial restrains, reduce the size of our government, and make it more efficient. If not done soon, we are going to face dire consequences - inflation and financial ruin.
We need to continue reforming our health care, environmental protection, and welfare systems. I urge more emphasis on technical and vocational education, and making our schools more competitive. We need more efforts made
towards ending homelessness, improving mental health and disability services, and reducing abortion and teenage
pregnancy rates.
I would like to see an immigration system overhaul which would put more emphasis on our labor needs. We need
to end the wars, regain control of our borders, and protect our laws, liberties, and sovereignty.

Statement: We need jobs now! You deserve good leadership. I am committed to moving Congress beyond partisan
gridlock. My lifetime of service and proven experience in business, health care, education and the military has given
me in depth understanding of the key issues and the ability to replace the rhetoric with real solutions.
As a small business owner, I have experienced firsthand the onerous taxes, fees and regulations that stifle growth
and job creation. As a County Council Member, I wrote and implemented the county plan targeted at supporting
and growing small businesses and keeping families in their homes. As a mayor, I wrote balanced budgets, reduced taxes, and increased services. I will take strategic thinking to Congress and lead the charge to revitalize our
economy. As a physician and humanitarian, I am committed to ensuring health care is affordable and accessible for
all citizens without the current mandates. As an educator and university president, I have witnessed the failings of
our education system. I am committed to making education a national priority and will fight to build a 21st century
education system. As a former Army General and combat veteran, when elected I will be the most senior military
member of Congress. I am committed to leading the effort to preserve our defenses, provide for our troops, military
families and ensure our veterans receive the support and respect they have earned.
We are perfectly placed to be a global leader in trade, innovation and to continue our vital role in America’s defenses. We are a great nation, a symbol of freedom around the world. Our leaders are failing us. I am asking for your
vote to restore effective leadership and responsible representation to Washington D.C. and continue my lifetime of
service as your first Congressman from the 10th District.

Elected Experience: Steilacoom Historical School (District 1) board member, 1997--2004; Pierce County Councilman,
2003-Present
Other Professional Experience: USAF Retired Lieutenant Colonel with 22-year military career, including 5 years as
McChord Chief of Quality Management, Director of Airlift Operations, Incirlik Air Base, Turkey 1989-91 (Operations
Desert Shield, Desert Storm, and Provide Comfort).
Education: Masters of Public Administration, Golden Gate University, 1987; B.S. in Environmental Health, University
Massachusetts Amherst, 1975; Numerous professional military education courses.
Community Service: Charter member, Kiwanis Club of Steilacoom; Past board member, Steilacoom Historical Museum Association; Breakfast Team Leader, St. John Bosco; Youth wrestling coach.
Statement: Dick Muri is a leader in local government, a retired Lt. Colonel and the clear choice to serve as our U.S.
Representative for the new 10th District.
Where Congress has failed to work together, balance the budget or solve problems, Dick Muri has succeeded. As a
member of the Pierce County Council Muri balanced nine county budgets, trimming wasteful spending and guaranteeing vital services were funded without raising taxes. As the Chair of the Performance Audit committee he
brought real accountability to government. With proper leadership, Congress can do the same.
Dick Muri knows that Congress is dysfunctional, "I can't believe the nation that defeated communism and fascism
can be destroyed by our inability to balance the federal budget. The simple truth is that Congress is choosing to
fail." As our U.S. Representative Dick Muri will rebuild our economy, support a balanced budget, restore federalism
and protect our natural environment.
While on the County Council, Muri supported a pro-jobs package of reforms that helped create jobs by making it
easier for businesses to grow and prosper. Dick knows that only people create jobs, not big government.
Dick Muri will work to restore federalism, returning power to our state and local governments. Dick trusts local leaders to make decisions more than he trusts D.C. One of Dick's most important achievements on the County Council
was to purchase more land for recreation and wildlife habitat. This respects private property and protects the environment.
When America faced the dangers of the Cold War, Dick Muri volunteered for the Air Force. A combat veteran, he
flew as a navigator and later led one of the nation's largest airlifts. Dick and Mary Muri have been married for 33
years. They have four grown children and four grandchildren. They family attends St. John Bosco Catholic Church.

(Prefers Democratic Party)
Elected Experience: State Representative, elected to five terms. Chaired historic Basic Education Subcommittee.
Other Professional Experience: Co-Founder, Intrepid Learning Solutions; Co-Founder and President, TVW – Washington’s version of C-SPAN; Chief of Staff, Governor Booth Gardner (1989-1993); Co-Founder, Bruin Development.
Education: B.A. - The Evergreen State College
Community Service: Denny and his wife of 36 years, Paula (a retired middle school principal), helped create the
Olympia School District Foundation’s Principals Emergency Checkbook Fund, providing low income children with
supplies to be successful in school. Denny was a Trustee for The Evergreen State College, served on the Board of
the Washington State Historical Society and on the Washington Learns Commission.
Statement: I believe America is strongest when America’s middle class is strong. I’m running for Congress because
the other Washington isn’t doing enough to help grow and strengthen the American middle class and those working to get into it.
We need leaders in Congress who will put job creation at the top of our nation’s agenda. I've spent the last decade
growing small businesses and creating hundreds of Washington State family wage jobs.
We have to rebuild our nation’s infrastructure, support our growing clean energy sector, and revitalize manufacturing so that we make things in America again. We also need to ensure we have the best workforce in the world by
making smart investments in K-12, technical and higher education.
As the brother of a fallen Vietnam veteran, I understand the obligation our nation has to those who serve in our
armed forces. Congress must make sure TRICARE and the VA are providing our veterans and military families with
the best quality healthcare. Congress also must ensure that those leaving active duty and re-entering the civilian
workforce get the educational and job opportunities they deserve.
Our nation also has an obligation to our seniors. Social Security and Medicare are two of the most successful programs in our nation’s history. Reforms will need to be made to strengthen and preserve these programs for future
generations, but I won’t accept changes that cut Social Security benefits to current recipients or that turn Medicare
into a voucher system.
I grew up in a working class family. My parents taught me through their words and their actions that in America, if
you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead. That’s the America I believe in for my sons Bob and Trey
and that’s the America I’ll fight for everyday in Congress.

Elected experience: I have never held an elected position.
Other Professional Experience: For the past ten years I have been a teacher of 7th graders. Prior to this I worked
at the Wilcox Farms milk packaging plant and the Miller Brewery. I have been a fiberglass laminator, construction
worker, and printing press operator. I spent 13 years in sales and sales support.
Education: BA in Cultural Studies from TESC, Teaching Certificate from St. Martin's College, Master's in Teaching
from Heritage University
Community Service: I have been a soccer and wrestling coach and served on the Lake Lawrence Management District steering committee.
Statement: I am running for Washington State's newly created tenth congressional district seat. I am running as an
independent and I am doing so because I believe that Washington needs a new outlook. I believe that if we want to
get Washington D.C. working the way that it should, we must send a very clear message that partisanship is no longer acceptable. It is time for people from all along the political spectrum to put aside their differences, have civil discourse, and create solutions to the problems that confront us. We send this message by not electing representatives
from the two major political parties. I am the candidate for people who feel the parties no longer represent them.
I am currently a teacher, and in the school reform discussion I feel that teachers' voices are too often ignored. I will
bring a real teacher's voice to the education reform debate. I will work to protect and strengthen Medicare and Social Security. I will work to control government spending in ways that do not cut vital programs to our citizens. I will
search for reasonable and responsible new sources of funding. I will support the continued development of green
energy technology and promote the green energy industry.
I am not a politician. I am a citizen that is concerned enough about the way our country is being run that I want to
help to fix the problems. Money plays too large a part in our political process. I do not want to represent political
parties, corporations, PACs, nor any other special interest groups with deep pockets. I only want to represent the
people of Washington State's 10th congressional district and work for the future that we all deserve. Steve Hannon

Statement: I am honored to stand with thousands of Washingtonians who believe strongly in family values, quality
education for children, and that our dedicated soldiers and their families deserve our unwavering support.
My professional experience coupled with my history of working directly with individuals who have been marginalized and disenfranchised uniquely positions me to be an effective team player and leader-willing to labor with our
elected officials toward healing our nation and restoring the strength of our communities.
When dealing with people whose circumstances impinge upon their basic human needs, it is essential to communicate in a way whereby each person feels their issues and concerns have been acknowledged and not dismissed.
This humbles me to stand with many citizens including our seniors who are ready for a change and not willing to
accept being ignored. Our seniors are the true pillars of our society and are entitled to a quality of life that exemplifies our respect and admiration.
The breakdown of traditional family values, economic disparity, lack of education, and the pervasive use of illegal
and legalized drugs, all have systematically eroded our country’s long standing morals and values that were once
at the forefront of our American society. Although these problems only scratch the surface, they deserve immediate attention and adequate resources because the effects are at critical proportions and are detrimental to the future
of our society as a whole. I believe education is a vital key to assuring America’s future to successfully compete in
a global arena. Our children deserve every opportunity to enhance their ability to be productive members of our
society.
I am you Washington, and as your congress woman, I can work to mediate both houses to promote substantial improvements to the quality of life we all deserve.

Chicago, IL.
Statement: Sue Gunn offers a passion for justice, optimism, and experience working with Congress and the Administration. As a progressive independent, I'll work to improve the lives of people and protect the environment instead
of promoting party politics. I'll listen to your concerns and work hard to create solutions to these problems through
outreach to diverse groups and coalition building.
I believe the time for tinkering around the margin of our complex problems has long passed. It's now time for
systematic change that challenges the corporate dominance that has left us with a dysfunctional political system,
endless war, polluted soil, water and atmosphere and a degraded economy that has left many without homes, jobs
or quality health care.
Support for Individuals: All people should have access to a single-payer health care system, full-employment, a
living wage, equitable, quality education and the knowledge that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are protected.
Reduce Military Spending: We need to build a new type of security based on healthy, economically-stable individuals, families, and communities. We must reduce military spending and bring our troops home from Afghanistan,
close foreign bases, reduce weapons R&D and procurement, reduce conventional force size, and cut the nuclear
arsenal.
Harness Corporate Power: All multi-state and multi-national corporations should be federally chartered to protect
the public interest and the constitution needs to be amended to eliminate corporate personhood and overturn the
Citizens United decision.
Create a National Restoration Corps: The Corps would allow young people an entrance to the job market, a means
to learn discipline, skills and service to their country along with providing for full employment. Emphasis would be
on repair of our aging infrastructure, clean up of polluted sites, and repair or relocation of communities devastated
by the impacts of natural disasters and climate change.

Marilyn and Rob are the parents of four children who have attended public school, and their passion for education led him to serve as president of the Bellevue Schools Foundation and Bellevue College Foundation. Rob’s education platform is simple - put students first, fully fund our schools
and stop cutting our colleges and universities.
Rob knows the private sector creates jobs, not government. He traveled across Washington learning from small
business owners about our state’s burdensome tax system and redundant regulations. His New Direction plan cuts
government red tape, provides small business tax relief and reduces health care costs by giving employees greater
control over their health spending.
McKenna has been a leader as Washington’s Attorney General, reducing staff while increasing productivity. He
made the office a national model for protecting consumers from mortgage fraud and identity theft, earning his
peers' bipartisan “Outstanding Attorney General” award.
McKenna grew up in a military family. Living around the world gave him a great appreciation for different backgrounds and viewpoints. Rob used that experience to build bipartisan support for laws fighting prescription drug
abuse, domestic violence and to crack down on sex offenders.
Washington faces tough budget challenges that threaten public schools and higher education, the social safety net
and our economic future. Rob McKenna is an experienced leader who works across party lines to solve problems.
For great public schools, government reform and more private sector job creation, please vote Rob McKenna for
Governor.

Governor
Jay Inslee
(Prefers Democratic Party)
Elected Experience: Washington State House of Representatives – 1989-1992 representing Yakima Valley; U.S.
House of Representatives 1993-1994 representing Eastern Washington; U.S. House of Representatives 1999-2012
representing Kitsap, King and Snohomish counties.
Other Professional Experience: Attorney, author of Apollo’s Fire: Igniting America’s Clean Energy Economy.
Education: Ingraham High School, Seattle, WA; graduated from the University of Washington with a B.A. in economics in 1972; graduated Magna Cum Laude from Willamette University Law School in 1976.
Community Service: Charter member of Hoopaholics to raise money for Childhaven; coached youth sports; served
as an honorary board member of the Washington Wildlife and Recreation Coalition.
Statement: My mission as governor is this - to create a stronger and growing economy for Washington. We invent,
we create, and we build. It was our innovations that led the revolution in aerospace, then software. Today we are on
the cusp of new revolutions in health sciences and clean energy technology. This is our moment to grow our economy and create jobs. We need to seize it.
Having lived, worked, and represented both sides of the Cascades, I understand how our economy works. Making
Washington a hub for clean energy will launch small businesses across the state, allowing wind and biofuels from
the east to power skyscrapers in the west.
To build this stronger economy and ensure every child has an opportunity for a successful future, we must adopt a
no-excuses approach to education. I’ll implement proven reforms that produce more innovative schools and insist
on high quality teachers in every classroom. We will prioritize our investments in: early childhood education; science, technology, engineering and math (STEM); and make college more accessible and affordable. No excuses.
I will bring this forward-thinking to our state by implementing lean management techniques to improve government services and efficiency and deliver health care at lower cost. In order to create change we need a leader who is
willing to buck the status quo. I am one of the few who voted against the bank bailout and the deregulation of Wall
Street.
We need a leader who is willing to protect senior citizens’ health care and pensions. I am the only candidate in this
race who will stand up to protect a woman’s right to choose, which is why I’ve been endorsed by Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest.
We can build a working Washington. I would be honored to have your vote.

Governor
Christian Joubert
(States No Party Preference)
Elected Experience: Yes.
Other Professional Experience: Journalist in Israel, taught social science, oenology, law (Europe, Seattle, Gonzaga
Law school, where I established the school’s international human rights law section). Worked in organic agriculture,
directed a holistic health retreat center. Litigated constitutional, products liability, medical and legal malpractice actions.
Education: French rural schools, Assumption Prep., Boston College (theater, sociology), University Massachusetts
(political science), journalism (Bordeaux), international relations (Jerusalem), political sociology, mainstream medicine, Chinese medicine, nutrition (Paris), naturopathy, Law (Europe).
Community Service: Legal and educational contributions to encourage industrial tobacco, allopathic modern medicine, the legal profession and the State to reconvert to a holistic approach to business.
Statement: As I showed during the 2008 gubernatorial run, thanks to which my Action Plan was embraced as the
third political force of the State, (http://www.christianforgovernor2008.com) our Republic is broken. The two party
system can not meet most of our basic needs. Our health, resources, jobs are too often un-necessarily sacrificed on
the altar of predatory economics and shortsighted ideology.
To meet these challenges, I respectfully propose a few policies, many of which would be implemented via executive
orders, given the urgency.
The first priority is hinged on a pro-active holistic health-care system in association with health freedoms advocacy
which will bestow upon each Washingtonian the best wellbeing conditions . Next focus, a sustainable economy via
affordable housing , clean energy “breakthroughs”, the billion dollars wellness and hemp (textile, paper, building,
fuel, medicine, food) industries, with the more traditional software, aerospace, agriculture and maritime trade.
The reduction of the legal work week to 35 hours and retirement at 60 (to provide jobs for our youth and save on
health costs), sustainable living wages pegged on inflation, tax breaks for progressive corporations and tax incentives to dissuade corporations from delocalizing production overseas is desirable .
Visionary leadership is needed to implement equal access to affordable and relevant education, art and civil justice,
the restructuring of our dysfunctional legal system and public financing of electoral campaigns.
This “Holistic Governorship” Plan would be financed via taxes against what destroys health and resources, including on financial speculation. Less “Government” and more tax relief in the “real” working economy with massive
funds from our innovative industries, including from the Great Statue of Responsibility and its Holistic Health Civic
Center, would contribute to reduce by half within four years the State’s debts and diseases while simultaneously
ensuring equal access to health, prosperity, education, security and justice.

Governor Governor
Shahram Hadian
(Prefers Republican Party)
Elected Experience: Proud to have no political experience- we need servant leaders, not career politicians.
Other Professional Experience: Hadian, founder of the Truth In Love Project, has real world experience serving his
community as a Christian pastor, police officer, teacher, coach, and small business owner.
Education: B.A., Puget Sound Christian College- Biblical Studies/Christian Ministry. Graduated 2nd in class, Washington State Law Enforcement Academy.
Community Service: Committed servant leader in the community: former neighborhood association president/
board member, Young Life leader, led overseas humanitarian missions trips, YWCA shelter volunteer, and leader in
the fight to pass new laws in Snohomish County, toughening lewd behavior laws and combating prostitution.
Statement: Hadian’s campaign is centered on the need for “courageous leadership” to tackle the root issues of our
moral, economic, and national security crisis, place principles before party politics, stand up and fight against political correctness, and clean house in our government and demand Constitutional integrity.
Shahram experienced a transformational life change 13 years ago when he committed his life to Jesus Christ. He
immediately faced persecution and disapproval from his family. According to Islam, his conversion means he is an
“apostate” and deserves death as a former muslim. In spite of this opposition, Shahram persevered and has been
a Christian pastor for 10 years.
Hadian boldly addresses root issues such as: tackling the power of public sector unions and working to become
a right-to-work state, deregulating our job creators- small businesses, gutting the Department of Ecology and its
strangling regulations, confronting the $1.5 billion/year impact of illegal immigration, and becoming energy independent by supporting renewable hydroelectricity.
Hadian proudly stands for the sanctity of life and marriage (one man, one woman). He believes we must restore
control of education to the local level, protect parental rights, and say “No” to federal “Race to the Top” education
standards. To protect our state’s 10th Amendment rights, Hadian will fight against unconstitutional UN Agenda 21
and its devastating effects on property rights, oppose Obamacare and work to solve healthcare at the state level
through common sense competitive solutions.
“We are One Nation Under God. We say ‘God Bless America’, but it is time that America blesses God and welcomes Him back into our nation. I am committed to lead Washington as a statesman, not a politician. Together, we
can bring Courageous Leadership to Washington State!" - Shahram Hadian
Shahram lives in Everett with his wife Michelle and two children.

L. Dale Sorgen
(Prefers Independent Party)
Elected Experience: I have no experience collecting a government paycheck.
Other Professional Experience: Computer Programmer, Pastor & Church Planter, Sultan Food Bank Treasurer,
Homeowner’s Association President & Treasurer, Small Business Entrepreneur.
Education: Graduate of Lee Academy, Clarksdale, MS, 1986. Bachelor of Business Administration, Delta State University, 1990. Master of Divinity, Mid-America Theological Seminary, 1999.
Community Service: Food Bank Volunteer, Science Curriculum committee, Boys and Girls Club youth volleyball
coach, Sultan Youth Basketball (SYB) coach, Sultan Youth football coach, School and PTA Volunteer.
Statement: There are two unfortunate, but prevailing, truths in our current political environment.
First, the two ruling political parties have been in control of us for a very long time and it appears evident that their
fight is no longer for us, the hardworking, tax paying people, but, instead, their fight is only to get, and keep, control and defeat the other political side. Their rule has been characterized by divisiveness and loyalty to party (partisanship), not the people.
The second great truth is that the influence of money has so corrupted our political process that our elections now
have the appearance of being purchased by the highest bidder, while the concerns of most hardworking, tax paying, people go unnoticed.
At The Imagine Liberty Campaign I am running as an independent candidate, not affiliated with any party, and we
are not asking for or accepting donations because government should represent all people, not just those individuals and groups who are buying influence.
On our website you can find the answers to the questions that motivate our campaign. The cause of liberty is great
because it entrusts people to make their own decisions about how they choose to live their life and it diminishes
the power by which some try to use government to enforce their expectations and wants upon others. The cause
of liberty is great because it takes control away from the parties and the powerful and gives control back to the
people.
We will be told again this year, as always, that this year’s election is too important to “waste our vote.” I suggest,
however, that the most powerful vote you could cast, this year, would be to break the cycle of control and have The
Courage to Think Independent.

Javier O. Lopez
(Prefers Republican Party)
Elected Experience: Community Action Committee
Other Professional Experience: Pomona Art Center, Pomona CA
Education: Art, Political Science, Public Administration, Law
Community Service: Food Bank, community Garden
Statement: My name is Javier O. Lopez, and I believe that all humans are good by nature. It takes a lot of hard work
to turn bad. Here in Washington we must find good people to govern, we need to fulfill our destiny of justice and
equality. I believe the time has come to speak of kindness and love. Those who speak of despair are practitioners of
hate. They should keep away from our highways, from our homes, from us. We need to recognize that all humans
can be of service, but don't let them become rulers of our state because they will make you suffer; they will make
your children and grandchildren debtors of their deeds.
Dear friends, dear Washingtonians keep commonsense, guard it with your life make sure you use it in this election
for it may be the most important election of your life.
As for me I only regret having one life to give to my country and it has already been given to the people. The road to
the heart is faith and good works, riches can be stolen, but the riches of the heart will be yours forever and ever and
keep in mind that double standards are the only tools they have and their deceit is without comfort, faith or value.
If there is righteousness in the heart there will be strength in the character. If there is beauty there is harmony in the
home. There will be order in the nation and there will be peace in the world, but only if people stop taking advantage
of you.
For example your present governor has given herself a raise while the nation is facing bankruptcy.
Vote for Javier O. Lopez and I will give my salary back to the taxpayers.

Education: Western Washington University, B.A., M.Ed.;
Anglican Theological College at UBC; University of
Washington, J.D.
Community Service: A leader in the safe water movement. Health educator and author of a foodways book
on nutrition, health, and the history of diet.
Statement: Many water districts add an industrial grade
of fluoride to drinking water – fluorosilicic acid. It contains lead and arsenic and leaches large amounts of lead
from pipes. The body excretes these chemicals poorly;
they accumulate lifetime. They are most harmful to
fetuses and infants (reducing IQ), diabetics, those with
arthritis and thyroid, kidney, and heart disease. Blacks
and Hispanics are impacted more than Whites. Chemical
companies earn a half billion dollar per year selling us
this filth. This racket must end.
Other Priorities: We are decapitalizing Washington, letting schools and infrastructure decline. Only the rich
can pay more, and they should. We need a tax on high
incomes and large capital gains. Washington should increase its minimum wage. Anything which can be grown
organically should be grown organically. GMO crops
should be outlawed and GMO foods labeled. Washington needs a master transportation plan and can do more
to reduce carbon emissions. We need stronger campaign
finance laws. Schools should have large, year-round gardens and serve more vegetables and less sugar and fat.
I run to raise issues others avoid. I will hold preconstitutional conventions around the state to study needed
structural changes.

Statement: Bill Finkbeiner knows the gridlock and partisan bickering in our State's Capitol is unacceptable. As
the Lieutenant Governor, Bill Finkbeiner will work with
both political parties to encourage a more cooperative,
less partisan, and less lobbyist-influenced government.
Bill Finkbeiner has the experience to succeed. He served
14 years in the Legislature, including a term as Senate
Majority Leader, before returning to private business.
Now, he's bringing his business and political experience
forward to push change through the marbled halls of the
Capitol.
Some of the reforms are simple, like getting rid of the
aisle that separates Republicans and Democrats on the
floor of the Senate. Other changes – reducing the number of partisan staff and limiting the influence of lobbyists – are more complicated; but all will make Olympia
more open to citizens and less beholden to special

other basic anti-poverty programs, be at least moderately anti-interventionist in her foreign policy outlook,
uphold the Constitution, and show independence, i.e.,
not letting party bosses dictate to her.
The Common Man’s Candidate for Lieutenant Governor:
I had to get on the ballot by petition, because I don’t
get funds from parties, special interest groups, or from
Establishment-types. After all, they realize that I am very
sincere in representing the common person’s interests,
not theirs.’ I'm a real democrat, though independent, not
a fake.
The environment is of fundamental importance as everything from the economy to morality relates to it. We
shouldn’t fool with Mother Nature recklessly, if at all, but
since the government has done so, we have to rectify
the wrongs through everything from mandating labeling
of GMO food to phasing out nuclear energy.
Our state and national constitutions together are the
firewall between democracy and totalitarianism, as democracy, after all, is the respect of differences of opinion
that we have with one another, and shown by certain essential functions such as voting. It’s a politician’s solemn
duty to uphold our constitutions.

and netted fi sh, often beside citizens engulfed in confl ict.
I returned home to start a family and private sector career, but my gratefulness inspired me to public service.
In the legislature I have earned a reputation of independence. I rewrote state law after the contested 2004
election to hold county auditors accountable, purge ineligible voters and make overseas military voting easier.
I spearheaded creation of the Economic Development
Commission and the virtual university WGU Washington. This year, I withstood partisan pressure and forced
the most bipartisan budget agreement in recent history.
My vision is to inspire performance excellence throughout government to improve the lives of people. As
Secretary, my offi ce will serve as a management model
to strengthen public confi dence in elections and set a
tone of non-partisan cooperation. I will fulfi ll the legacy
of this position as statewide advocate for trade and
economic development to expand exports and recruit
companies.

Statement: Washington is a state of many voices. From
the various tribes of the First Nations, to the pioneers,
to the immigrants from nearly every country on planet
Earth, Washington is culturally, ethically, and politically
diverse. Yet this diversity is not fully reflected in our
election system, nor is our system as secure as it could
be. My proposals are to eliminate the primary, to eliminate any definition of major or minor party by the state,
to have ballot access rule applicable to all parties and
independents equally, to have each candidate representing a party be the endorsed candidate of that party, to
institute Voter ID, to end Mail-in Voting and return to
precinct voting and paper ballots with absentee ballots
and provisional ballots available, and to prevent the
implementation of E-voting. These steps will put Washington in the forefront of safe, secure, equal and open
elections where Washingtonians of all political persuasions will be assured that their vote carry the same

protects their vote from hacking, loss or damage, and
fraud.

Kathleen has advised the Governor

Statement: ‘Impartial’, ‘Fair’. Washingtonians want
those qualities in their Secretary of State. And those are
the qualities I have shown throughout my life. I’m not a

committed to fair elections and increased voter participation. I authored our Ethics in Public Service law and
served on the Commission on Government Ethics and

I strongly oppose the Citizens United decision and support repeal. I’ll work to increase transparency in the

In 1992 I became the youngest woman ever elected to

unwavering in his work eliminating waste and holding
government accountable, ensuring we have transparent
government. We need his kind of leadership."
Troy believes in fiscal integrity. Leading by example, he

in this race to cut his pay and refuse all special session

I work professionally to make organizations faster, more efficient, and

Other Professional Experience: In
the 23 years since earning my MBA, I've done 150+ performance audits. I've been a successful executive and
principle consultant in large professional services firms
and run business units for Fortune 50 firms. I've worked

Education: BBA, MBA, George Washington University.
Community Service: Elected to leadership in Church,

good/open government issues. Active charity fundraiser.
Married 27 years; two children.
Statement: State auditor is a job for an independent
professional, not a politician. That’s why retiring state
auditor Brian Sonntag says “...[Watkins] is particularly
well qualified based on his experience and background
to advance the State Auditor’s Office and be an independent advocate for taxpayers.”
I have the judgment and real world experience to make
sure we get a dollar’s value from every dollar we pay in
taxes. Since earning my MBA, I’ve worked successfully
for 23 years to make organizations faster, more effective,
and more efficient – and we need more of that in Olympia.
My opponent is a professional politician who voted
repeatedly to weaken the auditor’s office, massively
increase state spending, and hike taxes. Now, he’s asking you to trust him to audit and evaluate the very same
government programs he voted to create! That’s like
asking a fox to watch the henhouse.
We need government we can trust. Citizens won’t allow
the legislature to raise taxes: efficiency and cost savings are the only way to fund our shared priorities while
rebuilding voter trust. As your state auditor, I pledge to
drive efficiency and effectiveness; to limit fraud, waste,
and abuse; and defend and expand open, transparent
government.

Education: I grew up in Tacoma,
Washington on an 'in city farm'. Had many animals and
allot of responsibility. Have always learned from watching nature, and have connected to it's soul my entire
life. I didn't know at the time how much this love would
grow. I attended the University of Washington and graduated with a degree in business administration. I had a
"born again" experience a few years ago while hiking in
Zion National Park, Utah. And now I know my love and
connection to nature are my purpose. I believe nature is
sacred. I am a guardian of it.
Community Service: No information submitted
Statement: Zeitgeist Washingtonians! The following
are destroying our natural resources: The federal government and it's many agencies, multi-national corporations, lobbyists, and the politicians who are overly
influenced by them. I am the no-party candidate, and
lifelong Washingtonian, I am a lover of nature and my
fellow man. I am not money, or power motivated.
I believe climate change is real. The incumbent admitted
our forests are dying, but isn't moving fast enough to
reverse the trend. He has had 4 years, and not enough to
show for it.
I will make clear-cutting of forests illegal on state and
private land. I will propose to legislature a "Tree Tax".
This tree tax will be used to fund our school trust. Eventually, I will eliminate our financial dependency to cut
timber on our public lands. This will help salmon runs,
and also help Puget Sound . A forest takes several hundred years to mature. We will run out of trees before we
run out of money.
We must protect our greatest asset, our natural resources. Ask yourself, "is the status-quo working? Then visit
zeitgeistmovie.com. There is a solution. I will make it
happen for us. I'm asking for your help.

Community Service: Former President and member of

Statement: A lifelong Eastern Washington rancher and
father of five, Peter Goldmark has restored integrity to
the management of nearly 15 million acres of forest,
agricultural land and water resources. Peter works hard
to maximize the potential for jobs, recreation, education,

Trained as a scientist, Peter understands the need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and address climate
change through renewable energy resources, which is
why he passed legislation to grow this exciting industry.
Peter led efforts to restore Puget Sound and promote
sustainable shellfish farming. He protected crucial habitat on Maury Island from international mining operations and launched Puget SoundCorps, putting youth
and veterans to work on vital cleanup projects.
Endorsed by the Washington Conservation Voters, Peter
knows that forests are essential to our quality of life,
supporting an industry that provides jobs to communities across our state, while providing clean air and water
to the benefit of all Washingtonians. That’s why he preserved 15,000 acres along the I-90 corridor, created the
Community Forest Trust to protect endangered timberlands, and kept forests open for recreation.

Elected Experience: No information submitted
Other Professional Experience:
Farmer/rancher, owner of Back
Forty Farms, our second-generation family farm; NFL player
1981 – 1989; Presidential appointee to Washington State
Committee of national Farm Service Agency 2000-2008.
Education: Graduated from Connell High School; B.S in

Community Service: Connell High School Football
Coach 1999-2009, coaching teams that included my
three sons (I also have one daughter with my wife of 30
years, Kristi, and 2 grandchildren), and winning 2 state
championships; Charity Tournament Director, “Fighting Children’s Cancer” 2004-2010; Member, Washington
State Farm Bureau.
Statement: In Washington, we depend on the land for
food, homes, business and recreation. But “We the People” also own millions of acres held in trust for us. Revenues from those lands (now, more than $200 million)
finance school construction and many county services.
But the state projections show that those revenues are
likely to go down in coming years.
But we can turn that around to protect our children’s’
future by generating more revenues through sustainable
uses of these properties.
I am a steward of the land-a second generation farmer in
the "breadbasket" known as the Columbia Basin, and an
avid sportsman. In order to be sustainable, I must farm
the land to be as productive as possible but at the same
time regard all environmental concerns including land/
water quality, and preservation of wildlife.
Much of the public lands are located in areas that have
had little “say” in Olympia. My goal is to change that
process. And I will run Department of Natural Resources
as a lean organization, watching over taxpayer dollars.
I’m a farmer who knows the land, the forests, the water
and the wildlife. I’d like to manage them for the citizens
of Washington.

Statement: To solve the problems in our educational
system, we need to celebrate our progress and share
best practices developed by successful students, teachers, and administrators. Once we focus on what is right
in our schools, we can work together to overcome obstacles. High-stakes testing and charter schools will not
help our students achieve. We need a variety of assessment methods throughout the year to determine what
students are learning and struggling with. Our schools
need to be safe places, free from bullying with high
quality STEM programs, visual/performing arts, athletics, and vocational education, so students develop a
variety of skills to prepare them to be successful adults.
Education is the most important thing that we do as a
civilization. Every dollar spent educating our citizens decreases unemployment and use of other social services
and increases our quality of life and ability of our people
to be resilient during difficult times.

Statement: For the past three years I’ve had the privilege of being your Superintendent of Public Instruction.
I first ran for this office in 2008 to reform education and
bring new leadership to Olympia, and in a few short
years, we’ve made a lot of progress: We replaced the
WASL with a better, fairer system of testing, Enacted
reforms to hold everyone in education more accountable for student learning, and improved our ability to
improve or remove struggling teachers, Created cuttingedge programs to prepare our kids for the jobs of the
future by partnering with companies like Microsoft and
Boeing, And I have consistently led the fight in Olympia
for more education funding to meet our constitutional
obligation to Washington’s kids.
I am running for re-election because the work is not
done. We must continue to reform our schools in order
to maintain high standards and increase accountability.
And we need to demand full funding of education so our
students have the tools and resources they need to get
the world-class education they deserve.
As a teacher, principal, and legislator I’ve always made
our kids’ future the highest priority.
I would appreciate your vote.

this state into becoming a place where everyone has the
opportunity for a good education. I recognize the need
for significant changes in our state educational system

will advocate during my term in office are the following:
1. Bonuses for teachers who are rated to be outstanding
by parents of students 2. Full state funding of education,
accompanied by a ban on special school levies for operations, and elimination of state business taxes. 3. Establishment of a three-level high school diploma system:

Statement: Every family should have the opportunity to
take responsibility for individualizing the public education of their own children. To that end, I propose a new
foundation for public education, of which the existing local public school districts would be an unchanged part.
This new foundation would consist of:
Individual Student Trust Accounts - for all students,
funded annually using each student’s existing $10,000+
state education voucher. With approval, each student’s
parents may spend these accumulating funds at any
Registered Public Education Program(s) of their choice.
A Registered Public Education Program would be any
educational program, regardless of ownership, which:
accepts only trust funds as tuition, i.e. "free”; fills at least
80% of its openings without admission qualification, i.e.
“open enrollment”; permits no organized devotional instruction or activities; and publishes measurable educational and behavioral goals for its students. Students not
achieving these goals may be dismissed.
Neighborhood Education Districts - three locally elected
trustees will oversee the educational progress of 50 to
200 participating neighborhood students. The trustees
must approve parental education choices for students
passing applicable WASL tests.
Community Facility Districts - locally elected, will own,
operate and maintain all public facilities. Life-cycle
maintenance funds will be included in the original bond
funding.

Community Service: US Army 1962-65; American Legion; Port of Seattle FTAC committee
Statement: Ex-Congressman Kriedler has been our
State's Insurance Commissioner for 11 years. It's time
for a change. Over the past seven years annual healthcare premiums increased 50% and employee share of
premiums increased by 63%. If premium trends continue
the average premium for family healthcare coverage will
rise 72 percent by 2020.
Our State Insurance Commissioner's system for regulating private insurance companies is outdated. It stifles
and limits competition. Access of affordable insurance
can be expanded through smarter regulations. Unfair
underwriting practices must be stopped to elminate
discrimination.
I will present a series of remedies to shortcomings of socalled "healthcare reform" to restore choice and increase
market availability. I will provide leadership for enabling
group purchasing of prescription drugs in this state to
lower healthcare coverage costs and reduce Co-pays.
State tort laws must be reformed to address rising costs
to medical care providers in order to make treatment
affordable.
With my four decades of experience as an independent

needs, I know how to get insurance cost down for consumers. As a former elected member of the Lake Washington's School Board, I worked for better schools by

Statement: It’s time for a new Insurance Commissioner.
Over the last 16 years politicians have run this office and
we now have fewer choices and costs have skyrocketed.
I will cut red tape, bureaucracy and reduce the mandates
insurance providers face which keep competing insurance products out of Washington that are available in
neighboring states.
I will reform the Insurance Commissioner’s office as
well. Staff has increased by 35%, to 225, with a budget
of $115 million per year. The result: insurance providers
are forced to spend your premium dollars complying
with burdensome and unnecessary paperwork rather
than paying claims.
I have 35 years experience in the insurance industry

Randi Becker
(Prefers Republican Party)
_________________________________
Elected Experience: State Senator,
2008 – present. Randi opposed tax
increases, voted to uphold the twothirds requirement to raise taxes
and earned the endorsements of
small business groups for her work
to create jobs.
Other Professional Experience: Randi worked for 24
years in the medical field, managing multi-million dollar
budgets as a medical administrator. Prior to that, she
worked as a realtor and flight attendant.
Education: Attended Green River Community College,
business studies; and continuing education during her
career in the medical field
Community Service: Active participant in local Chambers and service clubs, Graham Business Association,
Washington State History Museum Board, Backcountry
Horsemen, and Dollars for Scholars auctions
Statement: Randi Becker’s not a career politician. Before
being elected for the first time in 2008, Randi had a full
career in real estate and medical administration. But,
her neighbors wanted a legislator who listened and who
would not be tangled up in party politics or special interest agendas.
Randi has worked hard her whole life. She knows jobs
aren’t easy to find. As a Senator, she is trying to make it
easier for private businesses to hire and expand, clearing away regulations that hinder growth while improving infrastructure and education.
Randi has proven she gets results. She’s made improvements to our high education system and took a stand
against red light cameras. Randi is an avid fisher and
hunter and a member of the NRA. She and her husband,
Bob, live on a small farm near Eatonville.
“Four years from now, I would like to say – I made it a
little easier for people to get jobs and a little easier for
people to get good, career-building educations. I’d like
property owners and families to be able to say – Thanks
to Randi, I have more freedom to live my life without
government interference. I would appreciate your vote.”

us, the taxpayers, as an unlimited ATM Machine for their
wasteful spending.
I was disappointed to learn about Senator Becker’s decision to accept campaign contributions from one of the

Statement: During the 1980’s, as a young Marine Corps
Captain, I realized that the only possible solution to any
problem was to move forward. Today, bickering and
political paralysis plague needed policy decisions. This
has to change.
Since my tenure in the military I have been involved
in public decision-making and budgeting. As a County
Planning Commissioner I learned to balance the interests of economic development with those seeking community and quality of life. As an elected school board
member I advocated for more advanced curriculum
by promoting Advanced Placement classes and highly
capable studies. Today, as a college trustee, I oversee
a multi-million dollar budget, seeking ways to train and
educate students for the future. As a business owner I
understand the relationship between hard work and success.
But success is never easy. Though some would propose
simplistic solutions to complex budget problems most
of us know solutions are about finding realistic answers
that promote healthy communities and schools. Budget
solutions cannot be about cutting schools days; balancing the budget on the back of our kids.
In the Marines there was one rule: Lead, Follow, or Get
Out of the Way. It is time to remove the political paralysis.

2nd Legislative District, State Senator
Write-ins
Think twice.
A write-in line is provided on your ballot for each race regardless of the number of candidates. You have the option
to write in the name of a candidate not
on the ballot. Frivolous write-ins, such
as Mickey Mouse, result in additional
work and expenses to process.
You do not need to make a selection
in every race for your votes to count,
and write-in votes are not tallied by
name unless the total number of writein votes could make a difference in the
results of the election.
 Washington has a new election
 system. In each race for partisan
 office, the two candidates who
 received the most votes in the
 August primary advance to the
 November general election.
 Each candidate for partisan
 office may state a political
 party that he or she prefers. A
 candidate’s preference does not
 imply that the candidate is
 nominated or endorsed by the
 party, or that the party approves
 of or associates with that candidate.
 Vote for only one candidate in
 each race.

Education: Graduate of Washington High School in
Parkland, WA; Student at Pacific Lutheran University in
Parkland, WA
Community Service: Ecological restoration work with
Forterra
Statement: In these hard economic times, our first
priority must be creating jobs. First and foremost, we
need to invest in our infrastructure. This will create jobs
for working families now, and move us down a path of
economic stability.
We must strengthen our K-12 education system and
stop 14% annual increases in tuition at our top universities. By restoring funding for our schools we can reverse
the course politicians in Olympia have taken. Education
is what will lead to job creation in our communities.
However, merely throwing money at our problems will
not solve them. We need to encourage innovation at the
district and school level so that solutions can be found
to the diverse problems faced by our diverse schools.
As a college student whose scholarship was cut by the
Legislature, these challenges are personal for me. Like
so many other young people, I will now be forced into
debt in order to gain the education necessary to compete in the global economy. I intend to be a voice of the
future in the State Senate, focusing on education, which
will lead to the 21st century jobs our community deserves. I ask for your vote.

the values of integrity, hard work, independence, and
cooperation. These are the same values that I will bring
to the County Council.
We need civic leaders with real-world experience in land

Statement: Families know they must balance spending
with income and save for emergencies. So must government. Often, the county chooses the quick fi x: making
decisions that raise our cost of living, restrict our options, and mortgage our children’s future. Many problems are best solved with creativity, common sense, and
communication, not cash. Government must achieve
more with less money, cutting waste while adequately
funding the public goods and services that lift society
up.
Our quality of life depends on a good paying job. New
and growing businesses look for communities that
provide appealing educational, recreational, and cultural
facilities and quality healthcare. Vibrant local businesses
make Pierce County and Washington great.
Effi cient, affordable transportation provides access
those opportunities. Policymakers are shifting the cost
of transportation onto commuters and children, reducing mobility and harming struggling families. Transit
cuts stranded our most vulnerable citizens: primarily the
disabled and children.

Pierce County Council, District No. 6 Descriptions of Judicial Offices in the Primary
State Supreme Court
The Washington Supreme Court, located in Olympia, is the
state's highest court. The decisions of this court set the law
for all the other state courts in Washington.
Generally, cases are appealed from Superior Court to the
Washington Court of Appeals in the appropriate division, and
then to the Washington Supreme Court. Sometimes though,
a case has such broad public interest and requires a prompt
and final decision by the Washington Supreme Court that it
will go directly from Superior Court to the Washington
Supreme Court.
Court of Appeals
The Court of Appeals hears most cases appealed from Superior Court. Each case is decided
only after a transcript (written record of everything that was said in the trial proceedings in Superior Court -- or a video recording) is reviewed and oral and written arguments, called briefs,
have been considered. No witnesses testify in appeals cases.
The Court of Appeals is divided into three divisions and each division serves a geographic area
of the state.
Superior Court
Superior Courts or courts of general jurisdiction are found in each of Washington's 39 counties. These trial courts have the authority to hear all types of civil and criminal cases and to act
as appeals courts for cases from district and municipal courts. They are the only state courts
that can hold trials for civil cases involving over $75,000; title or possession of land (real property); legality of a tax, assessment, or toll; probate and domestic relations matters; felonies;
and appeals from district and municipal courts. Juvenile matters are heard by a division of the
Superior Courts.

Statement: Scott Stafne believes our high court needs
a fresh voice with a depth of legal experience that can
restore better legal interpretations to our judicial system. Currently he takes great issue with the Supreme
Court for not following their own rules, accepting poor
Court of Appeals decisions they do not challenge, and
issuing poor judgments without adequately stating their
reasons.
Scott Stafne is a lawyer’s lawyer – with more experience in diverse aspects of the law than the Justice he’s
opposing who’s been on the high court for 12 years. His
experience includes constitutional law, land use, marine
resources, personal injury, municipal and school systems law, admiralty law and much more.
He has spent his career defending their rights against
banks, insurance companies, municipalities, and government. Among his most reported cases: the firefighter
killed in the Fortymile fire outside Wenatchee; parents
challenging the 2009 Seattle School Closures and

faced with illegal foreclosures and credit problems, and
thousands of pro bono hours for people who could not
afford an attorney.
Scott says: “It’s time to shake up the Supreme Court
with people who have more depth of legal experience
than they have an agenda.”

Statement: The Washington Supreme Court is often
a citizen’s Court of last resort and has the final say on
issues of Washington law. The U.S. Constitution and
Washington State’s Constitution are the ultimate laws
upon which decisions must be made. The Constitution
should not be a living, breathing document that changes
with the whims of the Court in response to politics or
popular demand. The Constitution is the bedrock when
deciding cases. Judges should be elected without influence from a political party or special interest group. Voters should not settle for a judge who has been appointed by the most partisan office of the State. Nor should
a judicial candidate be allowed to purchase an election
through contributions from special interest groups and/
or attorneys whose cases could be the subject of that
Judge’s rulings. As a Supreme Court justice, I will insure
fundamental constitutional principals are not offended
or altered for the sake of accommodating prevailing
popular sentiment. I am not afraid to challenge prior
case law that misapplies fundamental constitutional
principals and rights. My tenure in the Supreme Court
will be one free of special interest associations or the
politics that can call into question Judge’s impartiality.

an educator and is the mother of two, Sheryl McCloud
understands the concerns of women and working families and will bring that connection to the Supreme Court

Richard B. Sanders
_________________________________
Legal/Judicial Experience: I served
on the Supreme Court until 2011,
first elected in 1995; and reelected
in 1998 and 2004. I wrote more
opinions than any other current
Justice. Before that, I practiced law
for 26 years. I also served as an adjunct professor teaching appellate
advocacy at the UW School of Law, and guest lectured
on state constitutional law at Seattle University.
Other Professional Experience: I am an Eagle Scout and
played for the University of Washington in the Rose
Bowl. (French horn!)
Education: B.S. and J.D., University of Washington
Community Service: I frequently lectured and wrote
many legal articles and opinion pieces explaining our
constitutional rights.
Statement: Why has Justice Tom Chambers endorsed
Richard Sanders to take his seat on the Court? Because
he knows Richard is a person of unquestioned integrity,
devoted to protecting the rights of all citizens.
Article 1, Section 1 of our constitution states: “governments...are established to protect and maintain individual rights.” I believe that’s also the job description
of a Supreme Court Justice: we must look out for the
“little guy” and protect citizen rights. Sometimes this
makes me seem conservative, as when I support property rights, and sometimes it makes me seem liberal,
as when I fight for free speech and personal rights to
privacy. But I am consistent: we have rights the government must not violate.
Thomas Jefferson said the God who gave us life gave us
liberty as well. It’s a good thought to remember. I have
support that cuts across the spectrum, with endorsements including: the State Republican and Libertarian
Parties; legislators; judges and civil libertarians-- and
more than 1,000 endorsers, including the Association of
Washington Business and Washington Realtors.
Richard Sanders has earned our support and protected
our rights. Vote to return Sanders to the Supreme Court.

You do not need to make a selection
in every race for your votes to count,

results of the election.
 Washington has a new election
 system. In each race for partisan

Statement: We can do better. The Superior Court is essential to American concepts of Rule of Law. Public trust
in judicial knowledge, appearance of fairness, respect
for parties/attorneys, and actual fairness and competence, is necessary to successfully implement the rule of
law.
The Tacoma Pierce County Bar Association recently
conducted a judicial performance survey assessing
these categories. Should voters return a judge ranked
by legal professionals appearing before them as being
in the bottom one-fourth or one-third of judges in each
and all of these categories based upon receiving “poor”
or “unacceptable” survey responses? Would you hire or
refer your neighbor to a surgeon, dentist, or physician
so rated/ranked by their peers?
I am experienced in Superior Court proceedings having
spent my career as litigant, administrator, and judicial
pro tem. I have received recognition by the Tacoma
Pierce County Bar Association (Liberty Bell Award), the
Washington State Bar Association (Local Hero Award),
the Pierce County Council, and Pierce County Executives
for my work and efforts for the citizens of Pierce County.
I ask for your vote to improve our Superior Court. I believe my experience, training, and demonstrated success
in the Superior Court qualifies me for your consideration.

Statement: People who end up in front of a Judge are
ususally not happy. Whether they are accused of a
crime, divorcing their spouse, arguing over a contract
or dealing with damage claims, standing up in front of a
court is generally unpleasant and expensive. That is why
it is important that the person who sits behind the bench
knows how you feel standing before it and does his or
her best to make the process fair and cost effective.
Unfortunately, the court system is now a place where
the Judge's empathy is lost behind a system of rules
and formalities that emphasize form over substance. As
our court system has expanded, its function has narrowed. Courts no longer strive to reduce the stress you
feel in front of a Judge, they augment it. And frequently,
they do so needlessly.
During the past 34 years Toni Froehling has experienced
with his clients the fear and apprehension that people
feel upon entering a court room and he has worked as
an advocate to help those people feel positive about
their justice system. He will provide the same service
from the bench. Ask your lawyer if it isn't time for a
change.

make sure our district and firefighters have the resources,

The Fire District has Reduced Spending
The district administration, firefighters and employees
have reduced costs to make the best use of every tax dollar, including taking pay cuts, furlough days and reduced
overtime. The district has lost 20% of its funding since
2009 and is expecting another 12% drop in funding over
the next two years.
Maintain High Quality Service
Approving the levy will maintain the quality service levels
and rapid response times that our citizens have come to
expect. Please vote yes to keep the services you deserve.

Rick Kuss, info@yesforemergencyservices.org,

Statement For Statement Against
East Pierce Fire and Rescue is placing an excess levy proposition on the August 7th, 2012 ballot. This proposition will authorize the fire district to collect $3.0 million to $3.2 million annually, at an approximate rate
of $0.38 to $0.43 per $1,000 of assessed valuation, for a two year period covering 2013 through 2014. The
proposition is presented to allow voters the opportunity to maintain current fire department services, personnel and reserves at current levels.
The fire district has lost over $2.2 million in revenue since 2009 and projects a further reduction of approximately $1.2 Million in 2013 due to the nationwide recession, necessitating cutbacks in expenditures and
drastic cuts to reserve funds, but without significant service level cuts thus far. Since 2009, the department
has reduced overtime, capital expenditures, and prevention, together with nearly $300,000 in cuts to maintenance, education, and training. All personnel have taken wage cuts, and positions have been left vacant due
to attrition. Reserves have been depleted by $2.3 million since 2009, a trend that cannot continue if no levy is
approved.
Approval of this proposition would maintain the current level of services. Rejection of this proposition would
lead to further reductions in service levels.

The Board of Fire Commissioners of Pierce County Fire Protection District No. 23 adopted Resolution No. 12-
002 proposing to authorize a new regular property tax levy rate. If passed, Proposition No. 1 would permit
the District to levy for collection in 2013 the regular property tax at the rate of $1.50 per $1,000 of assessed
valuation, thereby lifting the revenue limitation in Chapter 84.55 RCW. Should Proposition No. 1 be approved or rejected?
 Explanatory Statement
Statement For Statement Against
No statement was submitted

Pierce County Fire Protection District No. 23, serving the citizens of Ashford, Elbe and Alder, is placing a lid
lift proposition on the August 7, 2012 ballot. This proposition will re-authorize the property tax levy rate of
$1.50 per $1,000 of assessed valuation for 2013 tax collections. The proposition is presented to allow voters
to override the limitation imposed by state law, which would otherwise limit total property tax revenue to
101% of the previous year’s revenue, regardless of the authorized dollar rate limitation of $1.50, which voters approved many years ago.
This proposition meets the requirement of Chapter 84.55 RCW, that any revenue increase greater than 1%,
over the previous year, be approved by the voters.
Approval of this proposition would allow maintaining the current level of services. Rejection of this proposition would lead to the loss of up to $60,000 annually in projected tax revenues, which would necessitate
cutbacks in services.
Please help PCFD #23 maintain our service to Ashford, Elbe and Alder.
Proposition 1 is not a new tax but a reauthorization
for a tax that the community previously approved.
Costs for providing basic services to these communities, including supplies, fuel, equipment and
training continues to rise.
By law, since 2001, the fire district is allowed to
raise taxing levels by 1% each year. The district has
opted not to do this in nine of the last ten years. At
one time timber tax funds covered approximately
50% of our budget, but in the past year they only
covered 10% and are projected to continue to drop
in the foreseeable future.
The present tax is $1.03 per thousand dollars of assessed property value. Voting “Yes” would return
the rate to the previous $1.50. If we do not receive
this lid increase, we will be forced to reduce services.

 Explanatory Statement
Statement For Statement Against
Shall Valley Regional Fire Authority, serving the communities of Algona, Auburn and Pacific, be authorized
to continue voter-authorized benefit charges each year for six years, not to exceed an amount equal to sixty
percent of its operating budget, and be prohibited from imposing an additional property tax under RCW
52.26.140(1)(c)?
 Explanatory Statement
Statement For Statement Against
No statement was submitted
against this issue.
In 2006, voters from Algona, Auburn, and Pacific, approved the Fire Benefit Charge (FBC). Since 2008, the
FBC has supported about 44% of the Valley Regional Fire Authority (VRFA) operating budget. Every six
years, approval to continue the use of the FBC funding model is required by state law. Support of the FBC
for another six years will allow the VRFA to maintain response times and service levels for fire protection
and emergency medical aid calls.
The FBC is calculated based on occupancy type and square footage of structures. It reflects a direct and
proportional assessment of the cost of providing appropriate fire protection services. Each year the Board of
Governance reviews the FBC in a public hearing to ensure fiscal responsibility of this funding for the coming year. Revenue derived from the FBC is restricted by state law to not exceed 60% of the VRFA operating
budget. By approving the FBC, state law prohibits imposing an additional property tax of fifty (50) cents per
thousand dollars of assessed property value for fire protection services otherwise allowed by law. The law
allows discounts for senior citizens and for buildings with approved fire sprinkler systems. Property owners
may appeal their assessments.
Funding for essential services needs to be renewed.
This is not a new tax or a tax increase, but simply a
vote to maintain the current funding model. Valley
Regional Fire Authority has managed our tax dollars
very well while delivering superior fire & emergency
medical services to our communities.
The Fire Benefit Charge (FBC) is about 44% of the
department’s operating budget. Failure to renew
this funding model will result in fewer firefighters
available to respond, longer response times, less
training and elimination of important prevention
programs.
Our VRFA firefighters respond to many different
types of emergencies, from literally saving lives to
helping an older citizen up from a fall. These services protect our property and improve our quality
of life, providing value to our communities. Our
firefighter/EMT’s are always there for us, so please
join us in voting yes in support of them and maintain this vital funding.
