August 7, 2012 Primary and Special Election
King County
Official Local Voters’ Pamphlet
2 A letter from the Director
Dear King County Voter:
The August primary and November general election represent the grand fi nale of our
four year election cycle in this Presidential election year.
In keeping with the drama and intensity of Presidential year elections, this election
cycle, national headlines have focused on stories about what some consider to be
safeguards and others deem barriers to voter registration and voting. Registered voter purges,
requirements to provide government issued photo identifi cation, redistricting with the appearance of
isolating minority communities, and screening requirements for voter registration are examples of programs
creating controversy. Naturally, advocacy groups have lined up on both sides of these actions. Department
of Justice law suits and Supreme Court rulings have reined in some states to address any semblance of
voter discrimination. A prominent issue related to these actions is citizenship, and the fear that non-citizens
are taking part in our political process.
Citizen concerns about voting rights and voter fraud have increased. Recently, King County’s Election
Department has received inquiries about the efforts we take to research the validity of citizenship for voter
registration in our county, offering the opportunity to clarify myths about voter fraud.
I’ve seen immigrant citizens avoid their legal right to vote due to fears brought with them from their former
place of citizenship. Reports and proof of non-citizens illegally invading the ballot box are extremely rare.
Voter registration in Washington requires signing the required oath attesting that you meet the legal
qualifi cations. You are attesting to the fact that you are a citizen of the U.S. and at least 18. You are also
declaring you are not under the authority of Department of Corrections and have not been disqualifi ed from
voting due to a court order. Registering to vote and voting without meeting these qualifi cations constitutes
a violation of the law and is subject to prosecution. A registered voter or the prosecuting attorney has the
right to challenge a voter’s registration status. Having served as an elections offi cial in this state for over
16 years, I have witnessed very few voter challenges, and very rarely seen any challenges confi rmed as
voter fraud.
Successful challenges for fraud across the country also remain remarkably rare. Still, those states seeking
to impose voting restrictions cite voter fraud as the reason.
In Washington, every citizen age 18 or older meeting the legal requirements to vote are encouraged to
register and vote. King County Elections does not conduct background checks on voters or question
qualifi cations unless a challenge has been fi led.
Be aware of registration and voting deadlines and do not miss your opportunity to vote in our historic
Presidential year elections.
Best Regards,
Sherril Huff

Reading the local
voters’ pamphlet
Why are there measures and candidates in the local
voters’ pamphlet that are not on my ballot?
Don’t worry, your ballot is correct.
The measures and races on your ballot refl ect the
districts in which you are registered to vote. The local
voters’ pamphlet may cover multiple districts and
include measures and races outside of your districts.
What is an explanatory statement?
An explanatory statement is prepared by each district’s
attorney stating the effect of the ballot measure if
passed into law.
How are committees in favor of or in opposition to
a measure formed?
Districts choosing to participate in a local voters’
pamphlet are responsible for appointing committee
members who agree to write statements.
The statements are a way to persuade voters to vote
for or against a measure. King County Elections is
not responsible for the content or accuracy of the
statements.
What is the order of candidates in the local voters’
pamphlet?
Candidates in the local voters’ pamphlet appear in the
order they will appear on the ballot.
Candidates are given word limits based upon the
number of registered voters within each district.

About the
Top 2 Primary
Washington uses a “Top 2” system for its
primary election. A Top 2 primary allows voters
to vote for any candidate running in each
race. The two candidates who receive the
most votes in the primary election advance to
the general election. A candidate must also
receive at least 1% of the votes cast in that
race to advance to the general election.
The Top 2 primary applies to partisan offi ces.
It does not apply to elections for Precinct
Committee Offi cers. While there are some
slight variations, elections for nonpartisan
offi ce, such as city council or judge, are
conducted in a similar manner to the Top 2
primary. Generally, the two candidates in a
nonpartisan race who receive the most votes
in the primary advance to the general election.
You may wonder why some offi ces don’t
appear on the primary ballot. When only
one or two candidates fi le for a nonpartisan
offi ce, there is no primary and the candidates
automatically advance to the general election.
For partisan offi ces and some judicial offi ces,
there is still a primary even if only one or two
candidates fi le.

The complete text of this measure is available at the Elections Offi ce or
online at www.kingcounty.gov/elections.
Many homeowners already are struggling to meet fi nancial obligations and
don’t need another property tax increase but the Council is saying “yes” to
public employee unions and “no” to property tax relief. Don’t be fooled: if
the Council privatized some services now provided by county government,
revenue for capital improvements would be available. If voters continue
approving these levies, there’ll be more spending initiatives and more
Council demands for additional revenue to fund them.
Statement submitted by: John H. Shackleford
All nine members of the non-partisan King County Council voted
unanimously to send Prop. 1 to the voters. Public Safety and protecting
kids are NOT partisan issues. A new building will end wasteful repairs
and provide effi cient, compassionate service delivery—saving money and
lives. Children and families in King County deserve our support. Join with
Prosecutor Dan Satterburg, Presiding Judge Richard McDermott, former
Justice Bobbe Bridge and many more and VOTE YES for Prop. 1.
Statement submitted by: John McKay, Bobbe J. Bridge, and Estella Ortega
Anyone aspiring to become a homeowner should consider whether property
taxes now are so high that such ownership is problematic.The King County
Council nevertheless believes it needs more, not less, revenue during
diffi cult economic times and this request is its latest salvo in class warfare
waged for the benefi t of renters and the homeless, demographics relatively
unaffected by property tax increases. Again, the Council has declined to
propose a sales tax increase, opting instead for the property tax increase
it’s confi dent will pass because homeowners constitute less than half of
registered voters. Further, since the Council is indebted to public service
unions for the support which re-elects its members, there’s been no action
to reassign any governmental service to the private sector where it might be
delivered more economically.
Vote YES on Prop 1: YES FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES
The Children and Family Justice Center (“CFJC”) is where children and
families go in times of crisis: child abuse and neglect; foster care transition;
complex custody issues; juvenile offenses and truancy cases.
A growing population and economic diffi culties mean more kids and families
need care and protection, but current facilities are dangerously outdated and
failing our children. Brown water fl ows from drinking fountains, entire sections
are unusable, and electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems are beyond repair.
Financial reviews state that replacement—not temporary fi xes—is the least
expensive long-term solution.
Despite decrepit conditions, our court is leading in innovations for juvenile and
family justice. The new CFJC will better serve families and child advocates by
co-locating services like medical treatment, counseling, and placement. The
new design will improve safety, privacy and dignity. Combining services will
save millions in duplicative service providers and offi ces.
We cannot wait any longer. For less than $25/year for an average
household—less than 50¢/week—we can give hope to at risk kids and
families. A unanimous County Council, Dow Constantine, the Kent and
Auburn Mayors, and Bellevue Reporter agree - vote YES on Prop 1.
If approved by voters, Proposition 1 would authorize King County
to levy an additional regular property tax to fund the capital costs
of replacing and expanding the Children and Family Justice Center
located at 12th Avenue and East Alder Street in Seattle. The levy
would be authorized for a nine-year period with collection beginning
in 2013. In the fi rst year, the levy rate would be equal to or less
than seven cents ($0.07) per one thousand dollars ($1,000) of
assessed valuation on all taxable property within King County.
Annual increases for collection years 2014 through 2021 would be
governed by chapter 84.55 RCW, which limits the growth of the levy
amount to 1% per year.
The Children and Family Justice Center Replacement Project
includes a series of capital projects to design, remodel, construct,
and equip facilities for juvenile justice and family law services.
Capital projects include replacement of the Alder wing, Alder tower,
detention facilities, and associated parking facilities. Levy funds may
be used only for capital costs and incidental costs, including those
related to the sale, issuance and delivery of bonds. Levy funds may
not be used for the costs of maintenance and operations of the
facilities.
Proposition No. 1
Children and Family Services Center Capital Levy
The King County council passed Ordinance No. 17304
concerning a replacement facility for juvenile justice and
family law services. This proposition would authorize King
County to levy an additional property tax for nine years
to fund capital costs to replace the Children and Family
Justice Center, which serves the justice needs of children
and families. It would authorize King County to levy an
additional regular property tax of $0.07 per $1,000 of
assessed valuation for collection in 2013. Increases in the
following eight years would be subject to the limitations
in chapter 84.55 RCW, all as provided in Ordinance No.
17304. Should this proposition be:

Senator, 2010 – present
Other Professional Experience: Mike was
an economic development consultant and
former diplomat who advised international
and Northwest fi rms. In 2007 Mike served
as an Economics Offi cer at the US
Embassy in Baghdad, earning commendations from General Petraeus
and Ambassador Crocker. In 2009 he worked on a State Departmentcontracted counternarcotics program in Afghanistan, helping farmers grow
wheat.
Education: Gonzaga Prep, Pullman High; WSU – BA, Economics (1999);
Harvard – MPA, International Development (2002).
Community Service: Mike served as a Jesuit volunteer in Mozambique

Statement: Michael Baumgartner left a successful career in international
development to help his country in Iraq and Afghanistan. Then, he
challenged and defeated an entrenched incumbent and won election to
the State Senate.
As a State Senator, Michael has shown he can work with both parties to
fi nd pragmatic solutions, balance budgets, reform government spending
and improve education. He sponsored legislation to protect higher
education funding and prevent further cutbacks.
Michael has the background, experience, and common sense necessary
to be an outstanding U.S. Senator. He is endorsed by Senator Slade
Gorton, Attorney General Rob McKenna, Congresswoman Cathy
McMorris Rodgers, Secretary of State Sam Reed, and Representative
Cary Condotta. More important, Michael is supported by hundreds of
Washington small business owners, veterans, and educators. Michael and
his wife Eleanor have a young son, Conrad, and are expecting another
child this year.
“I love Washington. I was born and raised here, the son of two educators.
After studying at WSU and Harvard, my economic development career
took me around the world. Washington’s wonderful, natural environment
and friendly, innovative people make it the best place in the world.
“Now, America is struggling. In the past 12 years, reckless spending and
poorly planned wars have helped double the national debt and millions
don’t have jobs. Too many politicians care more about special interests
than fi nding solutions. The US Senate hasn’t passed a budget in more
than three years. DC is broken.
“I want to help turn things around, here and overseas. I’ve seen fi rsthand
the progress our troops have made in Afghanistan against amazing odds.
Now it’s time to bring them home and concentrate on rebuilding our
economy. Our children should inherit a thriving America - not one in debt
and decline. I’d be honored to have your vote. We’ve got work to do.”

Statement: The kids and grandkids inheritance $15,700,000,000,000
($15.7 trillion)DEBT. When the incumbent fi rst went to Washington D.C.
the National Debt was $4,188,092,106,183. Over the last 30 years the
people of the United States have paid $9,500,000,000,000 (9.5 trillion)
interest (usury) on this Debt; last year $454,000,000,000 was spent
covering interest. When the Federal Reserve Bank doubles the interest
rates, payment will double from $454 Billion to $908 Billion.
We have a serious problem; the postponement of dealing with this over
the years has left the United States in a precarious fi nancial situation.
I don’t have a SuperPac or millions of dollars; just Voters pamphlets,
website and hopefully your involvement, (facebook, twitter, dialog with
friends and neighbors) the only possible way to stop this train-wreck.
“As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public
credit. One method of preserving it is, to use it as sparingly as possible...”
President Washington
Potholes, bridges and other infrastructure could have been repaired had
the public credit been cherished instead of squandered.
“I place economy among the fi rst and most important virtues, and
public debt as the greatest of dangers to be feared. To preserve our
independence, we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. If
we run into such debt, we must be taxed in our meat and drink, in our
necessities and in our comforts, in our labor and in our amusements. If we
can prevent the government from wasting the labor of the people, under
the pretense of caring for them, they will be happy,” President Jefferson
We, the borrowers, are slaves to the lenders; austerity measures that

Other Professional Experience: No

Education: No information submitted
Community Service: As a direct result of
Will’s community service, Will believes the number one issue in the 2012
U.S. Senate election should be the illegal and unethical election practices
used by Washington Secretary of State Sam Reed. Fact: Secretary of
State Reed is in the business of manipulating State primary elections.
How? Fact: One way is to illegally and/or unethically manipulate/rig
information available to voters. How? Fact: Reed cancelled the entire
2010 and 2012 printed Washington State Primary Voters’ Pamphlets and
continues to hide information about how to appear in some counties local
Voters’ Pamphlet from some candidates.
Statement: I believe the number one issue in the 2012 U.S. Senate
election should be impeaching President Barack Obama specifi cally
for Obama’s decision to give America’s state of art military spy drone
technology to Iran (and through Iran to China and Russia).
The 1979 Iranian Revolution; Fact: America backed the Shah of Iran.
Fact: The Shah was a ruthless dictator who murdered his people. Fact:
The Iranians revolted against the Shah. Fact:. The Iranians hated America
for supporting the Shah. Fact: The Iranians took American hostages. Fact:
In 1979, President Jimmy Carter ordered a raid to rescue the hostages,
but the operation failed when the Delta Force’s helicopter crashed. 9/11
Terrorist Attack
Fact: On September 11, 2001, 19 al-Qaeda members on a suicide
mission hijacked four airplanes and fl ew three of those planes into
the world trade center towers and the Pentagon; killing thousands of
Americans. Fact: The leader of al-Qaeda was Osama bin Laden. Mr.
Commander In Chief
Fact: In November 2008, Obama was elected President and Commander
in Chief. Bye-bye Bin Laden Fact: In 2011, Obama ordered the raid that
killed Osama bin Laden. Fact: Obama ordered the special operations
commander who organized the bin Laden raid to throw in two additional
helicopters for backup. (Good decision, since one of the assault
helicopters crashed outside bin Laden’s compound.)
Fact: Seal Team Six destroyed the damaged helicopter before leaving
Pakistan. Fact: Now, Iran wants a nuclear weapon.
Fact: Obama’s administration has been fl ying stealth spy drones over
Iran to monitor Iran’s nuclear program. Fact: One of the drones crashed
in Iran. Fact: Obama didn’t send military personnel into Iran to retrieve
the drone, and didn’t blow-up the drone by remote before Iran grabbed it.
Fact: Now Iran has our stealth spy drone and they are not giving it back.

Art Coday
(Prefers Republican Party)
Elected Experience: None
Other Professional Experience: Art spent
six years in biochemical and heart research.
As a medical doctor he does house calls
and nursing home care, mainly for Medicare
(seniors, permanently disabled), Medicaid
(very poor), and uninsured patients.
Education: Art graduated from the Lakeside School, the University of
Washington (B.S. in Cellular and Molecular Biology; with college honors,
magna cum laude), and Harvard Medical School (M.D.).
Community Service: Art volunteered at the Seattle Children’s Hospital
Summer Camp for six years, working with children with special medical
needs. He served on nonprofi t boards, including three years for the North
Seattle Christian School, as Treasurer and President.
Statement: As a doctor, I fi ght for my patients. As your senator, I will fi ght
for you.
Patient fi nancial hardship and insurance status do not stop me from
caring. To accept low reimbursements, I reduced cost by eliminating my
offi ce; now I make house calls. Effective healthcare reform is needed, so
let’s repeal the healthcare act my opponent supported; it harms Medicare
and Medicaid and raises cost. Let’s rebuild Medicare, Medicaid, and the
VHA for our seniors, poor, disabled, and veterans. In the private market,
let’s demand transparency, fairness, and competition so you’re in charge
of affordable care.
Cutting spending, balancing the budget, reducing debt, and ending
infl ation will repair our national credit and stabilize the economy. As
a small business owner, I know that easing regulatory burdens and
mandates, enacting favorable trade policies, and lowering energy costs
will stimulate the economy. This will restore the catastrophic loss of
prosperity and American jobs sustained throughout my opponent’s 12-
year tenure.
I will defend your rights, including your right to keep and bear arms,
the right to life, and property rights. I support traditional family values.
We must maintain the world’s fi nest military to achieve peace through
strength. We must take good care of our veterans and military personnel,
and have a foreign policy that’s confi dently pro-America and pro-liberty,
supports allies like Israel, and is fi rmly resolved to defeat terrorism. Border
security is vital. My opponent won’t challenge her party boss on numerous
issues, like transferring nuclear waste from Hanford to Yucca Mountain; I
will.
The contrast between the incumbent and me is sharp; the record, not the
rhetoric, proves this. I am passionate about America, and with the right
leadership, our children will have a bright future.
Thank you for your trust and your vote. Serving you will be an honor.

1993-1995, Washington State Legislature
1987-1993
Other Professional Experience: Real
Networks, Vice President of Marketing &
Senior Vice President of the Consumer

Education: B.A. in Public Administration from Miami University
Community Service: Henry M. Jackson Foundation, Honorary Council
of Advisors; South Snohomish Chamber of Commerce, Former Board
Member; Mountlake Terrace Friends of the Library; Alderwood Rotary,
Former Board Member; Apollo Alliance, Founding Board Member
Statement: Congress is bogged down in partisanship and gridlock. But
Senator Maria Cantwell puts politics aside and does what’s right for our
state. Maria is focused on job creation and keeping America competitive in
the global economy - because she knows too many families are struggling
just to get by.
That’s why Maria is working to make sure Washington State remains
the hub of America’s aerospace industry. She fought unfair foreign
competition to help Boeing win the $35 billion Air Force contract that
could mean 11,000 jobs for our state. Now Maria is helping develop
apprenticeship and job training programs so we have a skilled workforce
for those jobs.
Maria’s fi ghting to increase Pell Grants and help middle class kids afford
college. She co-sponsored a bill giving returning veterans access to a
college education. She’s working to give laid-off workers and veterans
access to job training at community colleges so they can develop the skills
they need for new jobs.
To create opportunities for businesses to hire more workers, Maria voted
to cut taxes for small businesses and manufacturers while pushing banks
to loan to small businesses that want to grow. Maria recognizes that the
federal defi cit is a dagger pointed at the heart of our economy, so she’s
working to cut wasteful government spending. She is pushing to end
tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and instead provide
tax incentives for companies that create jobs here. And Maria is working
to develop Washington’s new clean energy industry, which will create
thousands of jobs across our state.
Maria kept her commitment to protect Social Security and Medicare,
fi ghting attempts by both parties to cut these vital programs.
Senator Maria Cantwell is focused on making life better for our families
and for the people of Washington State.

Other Professional Experience: Executive
Director, Progressive Congress Action Fund.
Principal, Afghanistan Study Group. Author,
A Responsible Plan to End the War in Iraq. Group Program Manager,
Microsoft and other software companies.
Education: Bachelor’s Degree in computer science with a special fi eld of

Community Service: Former president of Ames Lake Homeowners
Association; coached YMCA youth sports; led Hoppers, the Microsoft

Progressive Ideas Network, Netroots Foundation, ActBlue, Council for a
Livable World’s PeacePAC; NARAL Pro-Choice America.
Statement: Darcy Burner grew up in Nebraska, third out of fi ve children
in a blue collar military family headed by an Air Force veteran and public
school teacher. Her brother served in Iraq. She understands the rural way
of life, American values and protecting our country, and standing up for
our veterans who keep our country safe.
She has said that it makes no sense to spend more than $100 billion per
year in Afghanistan while we need schools and infrastructure built in our
own country. It’s long past time we had a realistic plan for returning control
of Afghanistan to the Afghan people and bringing our troops and money
home. That money – more than $250 million last year in this district alone
– should be invested in rebuilding our roads, bridges, and schools here
and ensuring that every child in Washington gets a world-class education.
Darcy has fought tooth and nail to protect the Social Security and
Medicare benefi ts people have paid for and earned.
All of the progress we need on the economy, health care, and education
requires fi xing our broken Congress. Darcy proposes putting a halt to
corporations buying elected offi cials by passing campaign fi nance and
lobbying reform; opening up Congress’s business to the public; and
forcing members of Congress to disclose earmarks and last-minute
changes to bills.
Darcy has been endorsed by the Democrats in the 42nd LD, 32nd LD,
10th LD, 44th LD, Snohomish County, and by the Ironworkers, IBEW
Local 46, UA Local 32, NOW, PeacePAC, Peace Action, and Democracy
for America.
Darcy Burner will make a difference for us because she is a proven fi ghter
who stands up to bullies and backs up her words with deeds to get things

Elected Experience: Elected to threeterms in the Washington State House of
Representatives; Elected to the Snohomish
County Council in 2001 where he currently
chairs the Law and Justice Committee/Human
Services Committee; Elected 2011 President
of the Washington State Association of
Counties
Other Professional Experience: Former business consultant before
being elected to the County Council; Third generation dairyman who
owned and operated his own business for 25 years
Education: Graduate of Arlington High School and Everett Community
College
Community Service: Snohomish County Agricultural Advisory
Committee; past Board President Arlington Christian School; attends
Arlington First Baptist Church
Statement: John Koster grew up on a dairy farm in Snohomish County
where his parents instilled in him a strong work ethic, honesty, and
responsibility. They taught him the value of a dollar and to be loyal to his
family, his faith, his community, and his country.
An independent thinker and trusted leader, John is deeply concerned
that our children and grandchildren will not have the same opportunities
as his generation. As your representative in Congress, John will work
tirelessly to roll back runaway government growth and spending. He will
work to remove unnecessary regulatory encumbrances placed on small
businesses which have caused the economy to sour while double-digit
unemployment rates have become commonplace.
There are fundamental differences between John Koster and liberals in
Congress who believe they should continue to borrow money from China
then tax you heavily to provide more government bailouts! John believes
in balanced budgets and, if elected, will work diligently for the passage of
a balanced budget amendment.
John Koster will stand against the immoral practice of piling
unconscionable debt upon future generations. His top priority as your
congressman will be to put people back to work and get the economy
back on track.
John will oppose efforts to put a government bureaucrat between you
and your doctor and supports a repeal and replacement of “ObamaCare”
with free market systems that will drive health care costs downward.
John believes Congress should move forward with a fairer, simpler tax
system which would generate the revenue we need to fund a smaller, less
wasteful federal government.
John Koster believes our nation’s economy can be great once again,
but only if we are willing to take dramatic steps to reign in the regulatory
agencies and unleash the job-creating power of the American free
enterprise system.

Network, the Digital Learning Commons, and the King County Library
System Foundation. Co-Chair of Discovery Community School’s parent
group. Lives in Kirkland with husband and two stepchildren.
Statement: My mother. My father. My sister. My two sisters-in-law. Over
the last few years, they’ve all battled cancer. And one of my sisters-in-law
died.
There are many reasons why I’m running for Congress at this time
of great turmoil over the economy, spending, and the future of Social
Security and Medicare. But defending President Obama’s health care law
is my most personal reason. I don’t want an insurance company to ever
again be able to deny coverage for a pre-existing condition.
I’ve fought these battles before. As a state legislator, I passed a law
helping low-income women get breast cancer treatment. I reached across
party lines to support our schools and balance the budget. I worked
with biotech fi rms and companies like Boeing and Microsoft to provide
incentives for job growth.
At this time of partisan gridlock, no one will out-work me to make change
happen. The fi ght for health care reform - just like the fi ght for jobs, to
support our veterans, for a woman’s right to choose, to strengthen Social
Security and Medicare, and for a tax system that ensures the wealthiest
1% pay their fair share - is hard work, especially with a budget so far out
of balance. We cannot saddle our children with debt they can never repay.
As a small businesswoman raising a family in a suburban neighborhood
with kids in public school, I live all of these issues every day. Just like you
do. I share your priorities of investing in education, health care, and job
creation. I haven’t given up, and I hope you haven’t either. I ask for your
vote so we can change Congress together.

Statement: I was touched by America before I ever set foot in this great
country. Growing up in Nepal, I was fortunate to attend a wonderful
school that was partly funded by Americans. When I came here in 1988, I
knew education was the path to achieving the American Dream. I worked
several jobs and earned my college and graduate degrees. I founded a
technology company, giving me unique insight into the industry that is
critical to our region and essential to America’s global competitiveness.
I am disillusioned by the inability of Congress to address the pressing
economic and social challenges facing America. The professional
politicians stand in the way of fundamental change because they are
beholden to the special interests that benefi t from the status quo. I will
break the stranglehold lobbyists have on the system, and I am the only
candidate in this race who refuses to accept contributions from special
interest PACs.
I am determined to reform the tax code so the wealthiest pay their fair
share; dramatically cut military spending; balance the budget; invest in
world-class education; rebuild our crumbling infrastructure; protect Social
Security and Medicare; ensure funding for Planned Parenthood; expand
the use of clean energy; guarantee marriage equality; and ensure that
our trade agreements include environmental standards and provisions to
protect American jobs.
Too many politicians don’t have the courage to stand up and fi ght for real
progressive change. I am the only candidate in this race to take a stand
against the proposed Coal Terminal because of the environmental threat
to our region. I am not a professional politician and I am not beholden
to the special interests. If you give me a chance to serve, I will always
remain true to the progressive values of our community. Thank you for
your consideration.

Statement: As your Congressman, I will bring sensible, independent
leadership and proven solutions to the issues that matter most to our
community.
I was born and raised in Snohomish County to a mother who came to this
country not knowing any English. She worked two jobs and taught me
the value of hard work. I worked my way through community college and
the University of Washington, then enlisted in the Army where I rose from
Private to Captain, and served in Kosovo and the Iraq war.
After active duty, my wife Pam and I decided to return home to raise our
three boys, all of whom attend public schools. Like you, we know what it’s
like to struggle in this economy. We have a mortgage, student loans, and
my middle son Truman has special needs. I know what it’s like to make
tough decisions.
I continued my service in the State Senate where I have a proven record
of fi ghting for good jobs and fi scally responsible budgets, protecting the
most vulnerable, standing up for aerospace and agriculture and focusing
on education. During my time in Senate, I learned working across party
lines doesn’t always make you popular. I also learned it’s more important
to work for what’s right than what’s popular.
Because of this, I earned the respect and backing of the business
community, labor, veterans, education leaders, farmers, and civil rights
advocates. I have the broad base of support needed to represent our
community.
Times have been tough for most of us. I believe by working together and
listening to each other, we can make our communities and our country
strong again. I have the hometown values and proven leadership that
we need in our next member of congress. Together we can build a better
Washington.

Suzan DelBene
(Prefers Democratic Party)
Elected Experience: Not an elected position,
but as Director of Washington’s Department
of Revenue I led efforts to reform and simplify
the tax system to help small businesses.
Other Professional Experience: Successful
career as businesswoman and entrepreneur.
Former Microsoft executive, led local hightech startups, and served as an advisor to an international non-profi t
helping struggling families.
Education: B.A., Reed College; M.B.A., University of Washington.
Community Service: I’ve mentored students at UW Business School,
been active in my church, serving as a board member. Volunteered with
the PTA, Girl Scouts and YWCA, supporting transitional housing, job
training and services to help families get back on their feet.
Statement: I’m running for Congress to stand up for the middle
class. This is personal for me.
Growing up, my dad lost his job and our family struggled. But thanks to
fi nancial aid, student loans and hard work, I was able to attend college,
get a good education and build a successful career as a businesswoman
and entrepreneur.
Today, I can’t tell the same story for our children. Today, Congress is too
busy working for powerful special interests rather than strengthening
America’s middle class. I will fi ght to change that.
Protecting the middle class. My life experience has taught me we need
to do more to revitalize our economy and protect working families and
seniors. We need policies that encourage innovation and job growth.
Economic prosperity for all is only possible with investments in schools,
student aid, roads and job-creating research. Instead of tax breaks for the
wealthy, I will rebuild the middle class by restoring these investments.
Standing up for our shared values. I support the “Buffett Rule” to make
millionaires pay their fair share. I will work to protect Social Security,
Medicare and a woman’s right to choose. I know what it takes to make
the tax system fairer. I implemented Washington’s successful tax amnesty
program, saving small businesses millions and helping close our state’s
budget defi cit. I will fi ght to eliminate tax breaks for oil companies and
crack down on Wall Street abuses.
A workhorse, not a show horse. I am proud to be endorsed by Rep.
Rick Larsen, Aerospace Machinists, Teamsters, the Snohomish County
Democrats, thousands of teachers and school employees across the state
and many others. They know that in Congress I will be a workhorse, not a
show horse. They know I am committed to making sure every family has
the opportunity to succeed.

Statement: Congress is broken, and continuing to elect Democrats or
Republicans perpetuates the problem. The only viable approach for
change is to elect an independent who will work for you. The way the
system works is that when candidates are elected to Congress they
become representatives of their party and special interest groups, not of
the people who elected them. Our country is being run by the parties, not
by elected representatives. It’s time to fi re the parties and hire someone
new.
When hiring a new Congressman the fi rst thing you need to do is look
at their resume. Does it show that they are a leader? Does it show they
are involved in their community? Do they have the skills and experience
necessary to make the tough decisions? How much do they know about
economics and job creation? Do they understand foreign affairs? Are they
ethical? Do they understand education? Are they concerned about the
environment in a holistic way?
I am that leader: a compassionate fi scal conservative who understands
the necessity of reducing our spending without hurting our most
vulnerable. It takes a clear economic plan to reduce taxes while
increasing revenue and paying off our huge mountain of debt. As
an economist I understand how the economic system works and as
an educator I know how to improve our educational system. As an
environmentalist and property rights advocate, I will protect both. As a
small businessman, I will not over-regulate you.
Hire me to be your representative in the US House. I’ll work to fi x
this economy, create more jobs than we’ve had in years, and create
opportunities for our children and grandchildren. Let’s take back our
country from extremists on the left and right. A vote for me is a vote for a
better tomorrow.

Sergeant, and 911 Center Operations
Commander.
Education: Graduated Everett Area
High School, Everett, PA; B.S. Psychology, University of Washington;
Washington State Police Academy, Army Airborne School, Ranger School,
and seminars relating to social issues and interpersonal skills.
Community Service: Keith has been serving his community his entire
adult life, either as a soldier or as a police offi cer. Keith has received
several leadership awards. Keith is a past member of the Fraternal Order
of Eagles. He has also helped coach Little League and junior wrestling.
Statement: Keith is running for Congress because government spending
is out of control, the United States Constitution is being undermined,
our borders are not secure, and our dependence on foreign energy
compromises foreign policy issues.
Keith is a Christian, social conservative, and pro-life advocate. Keith is
married and has four children. His oldest son is a cadet at West Point.
Keith supports a limited government that derives its powers from the
people based on a system of laws that must be obeyed by elected
offi cials. He maintains that the Second Amendment protects an
individual’s right to possess fi rearms and to use those arms for lawful
purposes. Keith is an avid outdoorsman, spending several weeks afi eld
every year.
Keith believes that this country needs to act in a fi scally conservative
manner and say “No” to spending, “No” to debt ceiling increases, “No”
to bailouts, and “No” to ‘cap and trade’ type legislation. Keith believes in
protecting citizens’ rights. He also believes that now is the time for people
to elect Congressmen who have the courage to enact legislation that will
close our borders to illegal immigration, allow for the immediate drilling
and mining of energy resources in our own country, and retain a military
force that can adequately protect the American people.
Keith is a man of honor and integrity who will not be intimidated or
coerced. He has the courage to stand up and do the right thing. Keith
has shown this courage as a soldier and police offi cer. He is a leader that
others look to for guidance. Keith’s word is his bond.
This is the year to return America to a country “of, by, and for the people”.
A vote for Keith Swank will help insure that. Thank you. God bless you.

1998-2005; US House of Representatives,

Other Professional Experience: Dave
served in the US Air Force Reserve (1971-
1976). He joined the King County Sheriff’s
Offi ce in 1972 and in 1998 became King
County’s fi rst elected sheriff in 30 years.
Education: Concordia Lutheran College, AA
Community Service: Served on King County’s Domestic Violence
Council. Board of Directors for Special Olympics of Washington. Co-Chair
of King County Methamphetamine Coalition. Former Member of King
County Committee to End Homelessness. Co-Founder of King County
Sheriff’s Police Activities League. Youth coach and counselor. Two time
Washington Medal of Valor Recipient. National Sheriff of the Year.
Statement: Leadership. As a public servant, my energy is focused
on spurring our economy, ensuring our children have access to good
schools, protecting our freedom to choose doctors, and defending the
vulnerable. Too many families are suffering, fi nding their hope and
budgets strained. Too often, government regulations and bloated budgets
have held back the private sector. I will continue working to reform our tax
code, cut spending, and reduce regulations in an effort to enhance private
sector innovation.
Integrity. Character and integrity make us who we are. In tough times,
it becomes all too easy to serve personal interests, forget the needs of
neighbors, and toss integrity aside. I have always served our community,
our state, and our nation with an optimistic spirit. I believe our best days
are ahead, and America will continue to be the greatest nation, because
we never surrender and we always pull together. We are free and must
fi ght to remain free for our children and grandchildren.
Service. From the fi rst day I put on my Air Force uniform until today, I
have committed myself to service. While a sheriff’s deputy, I saw the most
humbling acts of service and selfl ess sacrifi ces. I have a servant’s heart
and want to make America even better for the next generation. Every day,
I hope to earn your trust by serving with honesty and representing you
with integrity.
Teamwork. I’m a pragmatic leader, believing it’s more important to solve
problems than claim credit or be trapped in partisanship. Whether running
a small business, nursing the sick, tending an orchard, raising a family,
or serving in the military, everyone wonders why our problems persist.
With leadership founded on integrity, humble service, and teamwork, we
will put these tough days behind us and turn our energy toward the next
opportunities.

employed here in the State of Washington
Karen’s roots are fi rmly planted here. Karen
is committed to building communities across the Northwest with non-profi t
organizations to build food banks, day care centers, senior housing and
other vital services.
Education: Graduate of Rainer Beach High School, BA in Political
Science from Western Washington University, Masters of Public
Administration from Seattle University.
Community Service: She has volunteered with numerous nonprofi ts,
including Campfi re, United Way, Everett Libraries, National Grantmakers
Forum, TIPS, and The Salvation Army.
Statement: The infl uence of special interests on politics has resulted in
a system that does not work for us, it works for special interests. Karen
Porterfi eld has pledged not to take money from special interests so she
can focus on doing what is right for the people that elect her. Karen
wants to give the voters a true choice between herself and the incumbent
who has taken over $4.3 million in special interest contributions and has
supported oil companies, fi nancial institutions and Wall Street. Karen is
our best hope to get America back to work, begin reform of Wall Street,
build a world class educational system and invest in a sustainable
transportation infrastructure.
She has a history of community service and understands fi rst-hand
the needs of our communities. Karen has worked for the Salvation
Army, helped develop affordable housing, managed programs in rural
communities and raised over $300 million to help nonprofi ts serve our
communities. At Seattle University she teaches our future leaders in the
Masters of Public Administration program. Karen believes that the best
way to ensure our country’s greatness is to give back to our community.
We need to restore faith in our government. Porterfi eld’s goals are to
begin work to transform our government and economy by changing
the inequality of our tax structure. She opposes Republicans move to
dismantle or privatize social security and Medicare.
In 2010, the Seattle Times editorialized that the incumbent was
“woefully unprepared on issues ranging from wars to the economy.” In
the same year, the incumbent stated that the only reason he voted for
environmental bills was because he needed the support of environmental
groups to get reelected.
Please vote for Karen Porterfi eld for Congress. She will work to start to
restore America and our political process and will represent You.

Community Service: Current or former member of Sammamish and
Redmond Historical Societies and Issaquah Alps Trails Club. UW Jackson
School mentor. Komen Race for the Cure participant.
Statement: James Windle has the work ethic, courage, and experience
to best represent you in Congress. Windle is a product of the 8th District.
Born and raised in Sammamish, he graduated from Redmond High
School and worked for nearly a decade at his family’s gas station on
Mercer Island. He grew up as an active outdoorsman in Kittitas and
Chelan counties. After attending Washington State University and the
University of Washington as the fi rst college graduate in his family, Windle
pursued a real-world education in government in our nation’s Capital.
He built a successful public service career working closely with both
political parties in the White House budget offi ce, Congress, and federal
agencies. This unique experience has informed his balanced, clear vision
on creating jobs, increasing economic growth, and making Congress work
better for you.
Common-sense solutions that mix the best ideas of both political parties
will create the conditions for economic growth and opportunity. The choice
is not to cut or increase government spending. It is to cut ineffi ciency and
reinvest some savings wisely into education, agriculture, science, and
infrastructure. The choice is not to raise or cut taxes. It is a simpler, fairer
tax code that reduces everyone’s taxes and closes loopholes that give
preferential treatment to those who do not need it. Only an Independent
can propose and fi ght for this platform.
Windle is the candidate with the experience, knowledge, understanding
of national and local issues, and vision to serve the 8th District effectively
in Congress. His home in Snoqualmie Pass makes him accessible to
voters on both sides of the Cascades. His time in the federal government
will enable him to get you results. Elect Windle for Congress to move our
country forward with independent ideas and the courage to act.

Community Service: I’ve served as the Issaquah Republican Regional
Chair. I’ve been a Big Brother, and ministered to the poor, the homeless,
and nursing home residents. I’m a married fourth generation Washington
resident with eight adult children. I home schooled for ten years. I’m a
Christian.
Statement: I’ve assembled a superb prospective Congressional staff.
Bills have already been drafted that I will introduce to quickly reduce or
eliminate most taxes, signifi cantly cut unemployment, end the fraudulent
national debt, maintain entitlements, and rescue our military. We are in
dire circumstances. The battle to save our nation will be long and hard. It
will be won, in part, by you supporting and electing me.
Our Constitutional government is being dismantled. Most Congressional
incumbents shamefully ignore or cause it, thereby disqualifying
themselves for offi ce. Our survival requires their replacement. The
incumbent must not be reelected.
He voted against oil drilling in Alaska, increasing our gas prices. He voted
against development of oil shale areas, again increasing our gas prices.
He lobbied Congress for Obama to pass the Korea Trade Act, which is
projected to cause the loss of 159,000 U.S. jobs.
He, along with four Washington State Democrats and Jesse Jackson, Jr.,
sponsored the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Act that would have taken 22,173
acres of private property away from district voters and given their land to
the government. He also voted for the Omnibus Public Land Management
Act to take 2 million acres of private property away from U.S. citizens and
give their land to the government.
He voted to repeal Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, enshrining homosexuals in our
military. He voted to allow Obama to indefi nitely detain U.S. citizens,
without our Constitutional rights, under the 2012 National Defense
Authorization Act. He also voted for Cap and Trade, and TARP.
I would have voted oppositely on all the above, and will vote oppositely

Elected Experience: I would appreciate the
opportunity to serve the public in fi rst elected
offi ce.
Other Professional Experience: Proud
federal employee, NOAA.
Education: B. S., Accountancy, University of
Illinois
Community Service: Baptist. I proposed delaying conversion to dtv in
2009 to Congress. Because to justify allowing analog televisions› sales,
there should be analog reception for the televisions› lifetimes. Proposed
Judiciary Act of 1993 to Congress and the President in 1993 to neutralize
then eliminate the out-of-control U. S. supreme court (and its legislating
from the bench). I am a previous and current Congressional candidate
because I care enough to keep fi ghting for America and Americans.
Statement: I will fi ght for fairness for the 99% plus the 1%. I want to help
us all receive fairness. Always be careful of those trying to confuse or trick
you.
Everyone who is law-abiding must be included in our economy and
workforce and have a living wage. Our economy is great but it is not
sabotage proof. A small greedy part of the 1% must not be allowed to
be looters by taking advantage of do-nothing Congresses and a poorly
policed (deregulated) economy and fi nancial markets.
Fairness requires looking at each issue individually and choosing the fair
option. For some issues the fair option is more appealing to the left wing
and for other issues the fair option is more appealing to the right wing. It
is a mystery why the left and right choose the fair choice for some issues
and the unfair choice for others. Although, I believe the Democrats make
the fair choice the most often and on the most important issues, I will
make decisions based on what is fair not on what any political party says.
Fairness includes: government and businesses serving the people (not
the reverse); quality schools; fair free global trade; clean alternative
energy sources; supporting our troops and veterans economically and
fi nancially; not starting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan or bank bailout;
immigration law enforcement focused on abusive employers; a tax system
that is progressive for higher incomes; universal healthcare; Pro-life
(exceptions: rape, incest, signifi cant health risk); UN-focused world unity.
We Americans believes in Abraham Lincoln’s government of the people by
the people for the people. We can’t allow the greedy to continue to turn it
into government of the people by the corporation for the corporation.
I would appreciate your vote and the opportunity to fi ght for fairness for all.

Statement: I grew up in the city of SeaTac. My father worked as a ramp
serviceman, my mother a homemaker. I have lived my entire life in the
9th District. My wife Sara and I are now raising our two children, Kendall,
and Jack, in the 9th District where they have attended Tacoma public
schools. As a State Senator, Prosecutor, Congressman and member of
our community I have followed the values my parents taught--integrity,
hard work, personal responsibility and independence.
Creating jobs and growing our economy is my number one priority.
Working class families, like the one I grew up in, do not have the same
opportunities as previous generations. This must change. We need a
fairer tax code, better education and job training opportunities, improved
transportation infrastructure, a secure social safety net for our seniors,
and a fair plan to reduce our federal defi cit. We need to focus on the
fundamentals: more Americans back to work, better use of our tax dollars
and equal opportunity for all.
I have served on the Armed Services Committee for my entire time
in Congress and have always worked hard to make sure that our
servicemen, women and their families receive all of the support they need
and deserve. I will continue to do so and also believe that it’s time for us
to bring our troops home from Afghanistan as soon as we responsibly
can. We must quickly transition to Afghan control of security.
Right now our country needs leaders who are focused on confronting the
challenges we face head on. We cannot waste time on partisan politics
and ideological rhetoric. I am focused on fi nding solutions, working with
all members to solve our common problems. It is an honor to serve this
district in Congress, and I ask for your vote.

As a small business owner and teacher, I will work to rebuild our economy

Statement: Governments worldwide, including the United States, are outof-control assuming too much risk, spending too much money, interfering
with our lives, and damaging our economy, jobs, and businesses. These
policies will not work for us, but politicians know that they can get elected
by offering benefi ts they cannot pay for. We must repudiate them and
return to the constitutional principles that have made this country great.
You have a choice to make in this election. You can vote for more
government, more poverty, and more control over your lives; or you can
vote for freedom, dignity of the individual, and prosperity.
My program will save Social Security and Medicare while providing all
the promised benefi ts; restore sound money, stop infl ation which robs the
middle class, pay off the national debt, provide full employment and bring
back exported jobs and capital. No Bailouts.
We are on our way to becoming self-suffi cient in energy. We can produce
all the oil and gas that we need and stop importing oil. This has huge
economic benefi ts including jobs. This economy depends on oil for
transportation, land, air and sea, industry, and agriculture. We need $2.00
gasoline and diesel fuel again.
Our transportation systems are stagnant and have not improved for fi fty
years. Our roads are in gridlock but underutilized Progress in air and
space has stopped. Our automobiles are magnifi cent but they go no
faster. Our airplanes are stuck at the speed of sound. We went to the
moon but have retreated to earth orbit. We can do better.
We need a strong military to protect our nation but do not need
undeclared foreign wars which are not in our interest or wartime
restrictions on our civil liberties.

Statement: My name is John Orlinski and I am running for offi ce as an
independent Republican who is fi scally conservative and moderate on
social issues. I am seeking offi ce because I deeply care about our country
and its future. In this race, I want to represent the silent majority of people
who feel that their voices are not being heard by the bickering extremists
on both sides - people whose personal liberties, constitutional rights, and
individual freedoms are under attack.
Our government is out of control with bailouts, stimulus packages, and
crony-capitalism grants that have caused our budget defi cits to balloon
and increased our national debt by fi ve trillion dollars over the last three
years. We need to reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act and impose other
restrictions on the banking system so we can avoid future crises. Audit
and oversight of the Federal Reserve System should be implemented.
Our unemployment levels have remained high since the current recession
began. We need to do more in this area but the majority of our efforts
should be concentrated on increasing private employment levels. We
need to show more fi nancial restrains, reduce the size of our government,
and make it more effi cient. If not done soon, we are going to face dire
consequences - infl ation and fi nancial ruin.
We need to continue reforming our health care, environmental protection,
and welfare systems. I urge more emphasis on technical and vocational
education, and making our schools more competitive. We need more
efforts made towards ending homelessness, improving mental health and
disability services, and reducing abortion and teenage pregnancy rates.
I would like to see an immigration system overhaul which would put more
emphasis on our labor needs. We need to end the wars, regain control of
our borders, and protect our laws, liberties, and sovereignty.

Elected Experience: No information

Other Professional Experience: After
being a nonviolent participant in the 1999
WTO protests, I realized the solution to the
economic crisis required a competent policy.
I encountered LaRouche’s economic theory,
and realized the genius of Franklin Roosevelt. Over the years, I have
worked with LaRouche on many fronts: Cheney’s impeachment; stopping
Bush’s Social Security privatization; ending the wars and police state
measures under both Bush and Obama; organizing for Glass-Steagall
to stop the bail out of Wall Street. I’m running on a national slate of
LaRouche Democrats, to restore the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt and
John F. Kennedy.

Statement: “My politics are short and sweet, like the old woman’s dance.
I am in favor of a National Bank, the internal improvements system, and a
high protective tariff.” -Abraham Lincoln
Since the death of John F. Kennedy, our nation has gone into
an accelerated collapse under the policies collectively known as
“globalization”. We have systematically shut down our industrial and
manufacturing base, replacing an economy that was based on scientifi c
and technological advancement, with an economy that is now based
on fi nancial speculation and looting undeveloped nations. This was not
accidental, however. This was intentional.
“Globalization” is simply an extension of the “free trade” imperial policies
of the British East India Company. Today’s similar complex of international
banks and multinational cartels, seeks to destroy the sovereignty of
nations, and dictate living standards to the population. This modern
day British Empire enforces their rule through endless wars, police
state measures, and “free trade”. These are the policies we have been
subjected to under Bush and Obama, both of whom should have been
impeached. The global fi nancial system has now disintegrated, and
cannot be bailed out on the backs of the people. There is a solution. This
is my simple platform:
Glass- Steagall: Restore Franklin Roosevelt’s “Banking Act of 1933”.
Separate the Wall Street speculative gambling banks from our commercial
banks.
National Banking: The Federal Reserve System is hopelessly bankrupt.
We must reestablish Hamilton’s design for sovereign national banking.
NAWAPA XXI: A Kennedy era project that nearly passed Congress in
1964. It will provide 6 million jobs over 30 years, deliver 138 million acre
feet of water per year, and generate 42,000 MW of electricity. This will
be a part of the development of the Arctic region, which will become our
“window to space”, a laboratory to make advances in space exploration.

This is not a mistake. Due to a
vacancy, voters residing in the 1st
Congressional District prior to the
recent district boundary changes
must elect a Representative to
complete the 2012 session. This is
listed as “1 month short term” on

on their new district boundaries.
You are eligible to vote on all races

the U.S. Air Force, serving as an Imagery
Interpretation Analyst. In this role I made
substantial contributions to our country working within the intelligence
community during the Gulf War, the Iran/Iraq war, the Soviet Withdrawal
from Afghanistan, and numerous other arenas. This experience in

Education: Social Science, Linfi eld College.
Community Service: Past Board member,Washington County (Oregon)
Democrats and Young Democrat Coordinator. Youth football coach and
board member.
Statement: I am running for the position to represent the residents of
the First Congressional District because I feel that this offi ce should be
held by a strong Democrat who will lead with integrity as a hard working
advocate for the people. My history of service in the Air Force and the
Democratic Party, combined with my proven management experience in
the private sector uniquely qualifi es me to serve in this position. I am very
excited and honored at the opportunity to serve my district, my state and
my country.
I recognize that this is only a one-month position and that I won’t be able
to change the world during my term. What I promise you though, is that I
will work hard for our district.
We must address the defi cit . Over the last 11 years, the defi cit has grown
at an alarming rate. We need to work on cutting spending in a sensible
manner that will reduce the defi cit while not harming the fragile economic
recovery.
Take care of our Veterans. A huge number of our young men and women
have been asked to serve over and above what has been expected in
recent times. Scores of soldiers, sailors and airmen have been sent back
for second, third, or even more tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. We must
take care of their needs as they transition back to civilian life, and ensure
that the physical and emotional wounds from their service are given the
best possible care.
Continue strengthening the economy. The economy is clearly in recovery.
We need to continue to strengthen the economy by making well thoughtout investments in our workforce.

Other Professional Experience: Program Manager at Microsoft. Chief

Community Service: 10-year Board Member of Washington CASH, a

Network, the Digital Learning Commons, and the King County Library
System Foundation. Co-Chair of Discovery Community School’s parent
group. Lives in Kirkland with husband and two stepchildren.
Statement: My mother. My father. My sister. My two sisters-in-law. Over
the last few years, they’ve all battled cancer. And one of my sisters-in-law
died.
There are many reasons why I’m running for Congress at this time
of great turmoil over the economy, spending, and the future of Social
Security and Medicare. But defending President Obama’s health care law
is my most personal reason. I don’t want an insurance company to ever
again be able to deny coverage for a pre-existing condition.
I’ve fought these battles before. As a state legislator, I passed a law
helping low-income women get breast cancer treatment. I reached across
party lines to support our schools and balance the budget. I worked
with biotech fi rms and companies like Boeing and Microsoft to provide
incentives for job growth.
At this time of partisan gridlock, no one will out-work me to make change
happen. The fi ght for health care reform - just like the fi ght for jobs, to
support our veterans, for a woman’s right to choose, to strengthen Social
Security and Medicare, and for a tax system that ensures the wealthiest
1% pay their fair share - is hard work, especially with a budget so far out
of balance. We cannot saddle our children with debt they can never repay.
As a small businesswoman raising a family in a suburban neighborhood
with kids in public school, I live all of these issues every day. Just like you
do. I share your priorities of investing in education, health care, and job
creation. I haven’t given up, and I hope you haven’t either. I ask for your
vote so we can change Congress together.

Statement: I was touched by America before I ever set foot in this great
country. Growing up in Nepal, I was fortunate to attend a wonderful
school that was partly funded by Americans. When I came here in 1988, I
knew education was the path to achieving the American Dream. I worked
several jobs and earned my college and graduate degrees. I founded a
technology company, giving me unique insight into the industry that is
critical to our region and essential to America’s global competitiveness.
I am disillusioned by the inability of Congress to address the pressing
economic and social challenges facing America. The professional
politicians stand in the way of fundamental change because they are
beholden to the special interests that benefi t from the status quo. I will
break the stranglehold lobbyists have on the system, and I am the only
candidate in this race who refuses to accept contributions from special
interest PACs.
I am determined to reform the tax code so the wealthiest pay their fair
share; dramatically cut military spending; balance the budget; invest in
world-class education; rebuild our crumbling infrastructure; protect Social
Security and Medicare; ensure funding for Planned Parenthood; expand
the use of clean energy; guarantee marriage equality; and ensure that
our trade agreements include environmental standards and provisions to
protect American jobs.
Too many politicians don’t have the courage to stand up and fi ght for real
progressive change. I am the only candidate in this race to take a stand
against the proposed Coal Terminal because of the environmental threat
to our region. I am not a professional politician and I am not beholden
to the special interests. If you give me a chance to serve, I will always
remain true to the progressive values of our community. Thank you for
your consideration.

Many in the 1st Congressional know me; some do not. I am known for my
intelligence, zeal, abilities, grasp of things, zest, candor, understanding,
compassion, solving problems, and persuasiveness. I am a fi ghter for
my beliefs. I will bring and apply these qualities to this offi ce. I respect
this offi ce greatly, and this is not an ego trip. I am the only Veteran as a
candidate, the only one from Kitsap County, and over 65.
My political thinking is guided by the following persons. Disraeli said 200
years ago, “Great nations rise and fall. The people go from bondage
to spiritual truth, to great courage, from courage to liberty, from liberty
to abundance, from abundance to selfi shness, from selfi shness to
complacency, from complacency to apathy, from apathy to dependence,
from dependence back to bondage.” My fear is that we are three steps
away from bondage unless we do something about it. Ghandi recited
the “7 Blunders of the World” as “wealth without work, pleasure without
conscience, knowledge without morality, commerce without character,
science without humanity, worship without sacrifi ce, politics without
principle”. When asked will America survive, de Toqueville answered,
“Certainly, if it links itself to the eternals.” John Kennedy admonished,
“Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your
country.”
My theme for each is, “Is what I am doing in the public interest?”
Environment, fi nance, and excessive expectations are involved. We
cannot allow complacency for all have played a role in not linking us to the
eternals, and each must answer Kennedy. However, we must be diligent
to preserve our civil liberties.

Committee; past Board President Arlington Christian School; attends

Statement: John Koster grew up on a dairy farm in Snohomish County
where his parents instilled in him a strong work ethic, honesty, and
responsibility. They taught him the value of a dollar and to be loyal to his
family, his faith, his community, and his country.
An independent thinker and trusted leader, John is deeply concerned
that our children and grandchildren will not have the same opportunities
as his generation. As your representative in Congress, John will work
tirelessly to roll back runaway government growth and spending. He will
work to remove unnecessary regulatory encumbrances placed on small
businesses which have caused the economy to sour while double-digit
unemployment rates have become commonplace.
There are fundamental differences between John Koster and liberals in
Congress who believe they should continue to borrow money from China
then tax you heavily to provide more government bailouts! John believes
in balanced budgets and, if elected, will work diligently for the passage of
a balanced budget amendment.
John Koster will stand against the immoral practice of piling
unconscionable debt upon future generations. His top priority as your
congressman will be to put people back to work and get the economy
back on track.
John will oppose efforts to put a government bureaucrat between you
and your doctor and supports a repeal and replacement of “ObamaCare”
with free market systems that will drive health care costs downward.
John believes Congress should move forward with a fairer, simpler tax
system which would generate the revenue we need to fund a smaller, less
wasteful federal government.
John Koster believes our nation’s economy can be great once again,
but only if we are willing to take dramatic steps to reign in the regulatory
agencies and unleash the job-creating power of the American free
enterprise system.

demonstrated action. Congress needs to hear a voice that seeks to
inspire change. As your voice, I will challenge each member to shed party
politics. We must reach across the aisle, embrace each other, and resolve

urge you to take that chance and vote for me. I’ll get the job done.

school teacher. Her brother served in Iraq. She understands the rural way
of life, American values and protecting our country, and standing up for
our veterans who keep our country safe.
She has said that it makes no sense to spend more than $100 billion per
year in Afghanistan while we need schools and infrastructure built in our
own country. It’s long past time we had a realistic plan for returning control
of Afghanistan to the Afghan people and bringing our troops and money
home. That money – more than $250 million last year in this district alone
– should be invested in rebuilding our roads, bridges, and schools here
and ensuring that every child in Washington gets a world-class education.
Darcy has fought tooth and nail to protect the Social Security and
Medicare benefi ts people have paid for and earned.
All of the progress we need on the economy, health care, and education
requires fi xing our broken Congress. Darcy proposes putting a halt to
corporations buying elected offi cials by passing campaign fi nance and
lobbying reform; opening up Congress’s business to the public; and
forcing members of Congress to disclose earmarks and last-minute
changes to bills.
Darcy has been endorsed by the Democrats in the 42nd LD, 32nd LD,
10th LD, 44th LD, Snohomish County, and by the Ironworkers, IBEW
Local 46, UA Local 32, NOW, PeacePAC, Peace Action, and Democracy
for America.
Darcy Burner will make a difference for us because she is a proven fi ghter
who stands up to bullies and backs up her words with deeds to get things
done.

career as businesswoman and entrepreneur.
Former Microsoft executive, led local hightech startups, and served as an advisor to an international non-profi t

Statement: I’m running to fi ll the remainder of Rep. Inslee’s current term
(as well as the two-year term in the new 1st District) because the people
of this region deserve consistent representation in Congress at a time
when a number of important votes may come up.
Making the Right Decisions on Critical Issues. As Congress takes on
tough issues this December, I will stand up for the middle class. I will vote
to reduce the debt, end the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and protect
Social Security and Medicare.
Protecting the middle class. My life experience has taught me we need
to do more to revitalize our economy and protect working families and
seniors. We need policies that encourage innovation and job growth.
Economic prosperity for all is only possible with investments in schools,
student aid, roads and job-creating research. Instead of tax breaks for the
wealthy, I will rebuild the middle class by restoring these investments.
Standing up for our shared values. I support the “Buffett Rule” to make
millionaires pay their fair share. I will work to protect Social Security,
Medicare and a woman’s right to choose. I know what it takes to make
the tax system fairer. I implemented Washington’s successful tax amnesty
program, saving small businesses millions and helping close our state’s
budget defi cit. I will fi ght to eliminate tax breaks for oil companies and
crack down on Wall Street abuses.
A workhorse, not a show horse. I am proud to be endorsed by Gov.
Chris Gregoire, Aerospace Machinists, Teamsters, Snohomish County
Democrats, thousands of teachers and school employees across the state
and many others. They know that in Congress I will be a workhorse, not a
show horse. They know I am committed to making sure every family has
the opportunity to succeed.

Elected Experience: King County Council;
Washington State Attorney General
Other Professional Experience: Perkins
Coie law fi rm, 1988-1996
Education: University of Washington,

State PTA, 2008.
Statement: Son of a teacher and a soldier, Rob McKenna learned the
value of public service from his parents, and wants to continue serving
Washington’s people as Governor. He will take our state in a New
Direction, promoting excellence in public schools, helping innovative
businesses create jobs and reforming state government.
Rob graduated from Sammamish High and the UW. Marilyn and Rob
are the parents of four children who have attended public school, and
their passion for education led him to serve as president of the Bellevue
Schools Foundation and Bellevue College Foundation. Rob’s education
platform is simple - put students fi rst, fully fund our schools and stop
cutting our colleges and universities.
Rob knows the private sector creates jobs, not government. He traveled
across Washington learning from small business owners about our state’s
burdensome tax system and redundant regulations. His New Direction
plan cuts government red tape, provides small business tax relief and
reduces health care costs by giving employees greater control over their
health spending.
McKenna has been a leader as Washington’s Attorney General, reducing
staff while increasing productivity. He made the offi ce a national model for
protecting consumers from mortgage fraud and identity theft, earning his
peers’ bipartisan “Outstanding Attorney General” award.
McKenna grew up in a military family. Living around the world gave him
a great appreciation for different backgrounds and viewpoints. Rob used
that experience to build bipartisan support for laws fi ghting prescription
drug abuse, domestic violence and to crack down on sex offenders.
Washington faces tough budget challenges that threaten public schools
and higher education, the social safety net and our economic future. Rob
McKenna is an experienced leader who works across party lines to solve
problems. For great public schools, government reform and more private
sector job creation, please vote Rob McKenna for Governor.

Representatives 1993-1994 representing
Eastern Washington; U.S. House of
Representatives 1999-2012 representing

Other Professional Experience: Attorney, author of Apollo’s Fire: Igniting

Education: Ingraham High School, Seattle, WA; graduated from the

Magna Cum Laude from Willamette University Law School in 1976.
Community Service: Charter member of Hoopaholics to raise money for
Childhaven; coached youth sports; served as an honorary board member
of the Washington Wildlife and Recreation Coalition.
Statement: My mission as governor is this - to create a stronger and
growing economy for Washington. We invent, we create, and we build. It
was our innovations that led the revolution in aerospace, then software.
Today we are on the cusp of new revolutions in health sciences and clean
energy technology. This is our moment to grow our economy and create
jobs. We need to seize it.
Having lived, worked, and represented both sides of the Cascades, I
understand how our economy works. Making Washington a hub for clean
energy will launch small businesses across the state, allowing wind and
biofuels from the east to power skyscrapers in the west.
To build this stronger economy and ensure every child has an opportunity
for a successful future, we must adopt a no-excuses approach to
education. I’ll implement proven reforms that produce more innovative
schools and insist on high quality teachers in every classroom. We
will prioritize our investments in: early childhood education; science,
technology, engineering and math (STEM); and make college more
accessible and affordable. No excuses.
I will bring this forward-thinking to our state by implementing lean
management techniques to improve government services and effi ciency
and deliver health care at lower cost. In order to create change we need
a leader who is willing to buck the status quo. I am one of the few who
voted against the bank bailout and the deregulation of Wall Street.
We need a leader who is willing to protect senior citizens’ health care and
pensions. I am the only candidate in this race who will stand up to protect
a woman’s right to choose, which is why I’ve been endorsed by Planned
Parenthood Votes Northwest.
We can build a working Washington. I would be honored to have your
vote.

Shahram Hadian
(Prefers Republican Party)
Elected Experience: Proud to have no
political experience- we need servant leaders,
not career politicians.
Other Professional Experience: Hadian,
founder of the Truth In Love Project, has real
world experience serving his community as a
Christian pastor, police offi cer, teacher, coach,
and small business owner.
Education: B.A., Puget Sound Christian College- Biblical Studies/
Christian Ministry. Graduated 2nd in class, Washington State Law
Enforcement Academy.
Community Service: Committed servant leader in the community: former
neighborhood association president/board member, Young Life leader, led
overseas humanitarian missions trips, YWCA shelter volunteer, and leader
in the fi ght to pass new laws in Snohomish County, toughening lewd
behavior laws and combating prostitution.
Statement: Hadian’s campaign is centered on the need for “courageous
leadership” to tackle the root issues of our moral, economic, and national
security crisis, place principles before party politics, stand up and fi ght
against political correctness, and clean house in our government and
demand Constitutional integrity.
Shahram experienced a transformational life change 13 years ago when
he committed his life to Jesus Christ. He immediately faced persecution
and disapproval from his family. According to Islam, his conversion means
he is an “apostate” and deserves death as a former muslim. In spite of
this opposition, Shahram persevered and has been a Christian pastor for
10 years.
Hadian boldly addresses root issues such as: tackling the power of public
sector unions and working to become a right-to-work state, deregulating
our job creators- small businesses, gutting the Department of Ecology and
its strangling regulations, confronting the $1.5 billion/year impact of illegal
immigration, and becoming energy independent by supporting renewable
hydroelectricity.
Hadian proudly stands for the sanctity of life and marriage (one man,
one woman). He believes we must restore control of education to the
local level, protect parental rights, and say “No” to federal “Race to
the Top” education standards. To protect our state’s 10th Amendment
rights, Hadian will fi ght against unconstitutional UN Agenda 21 and its
devastating effects on property rights, oppose Obamacare and work to
solve healthcare at the state level through common sense competitive
solutions.
“We are One Nation Under God. We say ‘God Bless America’, but it is
time that America blesses God and welcomes Him back into our nation.
I am committed to lead Washington as a statesman, not a politician.
Together, we can bring Courageous Leadership to Washington State!” -

Christian Joubert
(States No Party Preference)
Elected Experience: Yes.
Other Professional Experience: Journalist
in Israel, taught social science, oenology,
law (Europe, Seattle, Gonzaga Law school,
where I established the school’s international
human rights law section). Worked in
organic agriculture, directed a holistic health
retreat center. Litigated constitutional, products liability, medical and legal
malpractice actions.
Education: French rural schools, Assumption Prep., Boston College
(theater, sociology), University Massachusetts (political science), journalism
(Bordeaux), international relations (Jerusalem), political sociology,
mainstream medicine, Chinese medicine, nutrition (Paris), naturopathy, Law
(Europe).
Community Service: Legal and educational contributions to encourage
industrial tobacco, allopathic modern medicine, the legal profession and the
State to reconvert to a holistic approach to business.
Statement: As I showed during the 2008 gubernatorial run, thanks to which
my Action Plan was embraced as the third political force of the State, (http://
www.christianforgovernor2008.com) our Republic is broken. The two party
system can not meet most of our basic needs. Our health, resources, jobs
are too often un-necessarily sacrifi ced on the altar of predatory economics
and shortsighted ideology.
To meet these challenges, I respectfully propose a few policies, many of
which would be implemented via executive orders, given the urgency.
The fi rst priority is hinged on a pro-active holistic health-care system in
association with health freedoms advocacy which will bestow upon each
Washingtonian the best wellbeing conditions . Next focus, a sustainable
economy via affordable housing , clean energy “breakthroughs”, the billion
dollars wellness and hemp (textile, paper, building, fuel, medicine, food)
industries, with the more traditional software, aerospace, agriculture and
maritime trade.
The reduction of the legal work week to 35 hours and retirement at 60 (to
provide jobs for our youth and save on health costs), sustainable living
wages pegged on infl ation, tax breaks for progressive corporations and tax
incentives to dissuade corporations from delocalizing production overseas is
desirable .
Visionary leadership is needed to implement equal access to affordable and
relevant education, art and civil justice, the restructuring of our dysfunctional
legal system and public fi nancing of electoral campaigns.
This “Holistic Governorship” Plan would be fi nanced via taxes against what
destroys health and resources, including on fi nancial speculation. Less
“Government” and more tax relief in the “real” working economy with massive
funds from our innovative industries, including from the Great Statue of
Responsibility and its Holistic Health Civic Center, would contribute to reduce
by half within four years the State’s debts and diseases while simultaneously
ensuring equal access to health, prosperity, education, security and justice.

Statement: Freedom! How much does it cost? With the high price of gas,
food, shelter, heat and electricty. With taxes on the rise where will it all
end. Our way of life is changing for the worse. We cannot take anything
for granted,not even going to the store. Choosing between food and gas
is disheartening. Common sence is a thing of the past along with moral
values. .What is the truth about our goverment and how can we change
it. Lies ,waste and fear is on the daily news. Excessive use of force about
police in this state is what we hear all to often . We are becomeing a
military state under fear from our own goverment. How sad! When will
our goverment completely fail , not if it will fail. We the people are fedup
with goverment not doing right by us. I am part of the 99 percent . I have
worked hard at foundries for 7 years and aerospace for 25 years. I have
learned that when times are hard ,(Work hard) and when times are good
(Work harder). You don,t know whe times will be good again. Buying extra
is a thing of the past. Just having enough is a challenge. Rich are getting
richer and the middle class is the next poor. What about our children will
they own a house? I feel I can change this with your help. Goverment
needs debt counselling and restructuring. Stop wasting your money
on special interests and lavish needs. I am hard working, mechanically

Education: Graduate of Lee Academy, Clarksdale, MS, 1986. Bachelor of

Community Service: Food Bank Volunteer, Science Curriculum
committee, Boys and Girls Club youth volleyball coach, Sultan Youth
Basketball (SYB) coach, Sultan Youth football coach, School and PTA
Volunteer.
Statement: There are two unfortunate, but prevailing, truths in our current
political environment.
First, the two ruling political parties have been in control of us for a very
long time and it appears evident that their fi ght is no longer for us, the
hardworking, tax paying people, but, instead, their fi ght is only to get,
and keep, control and defeat the other political side. Their rule has been
characterized by divisiveness and loyalty to party (partisanship), not the
people.
The second great truth is that the infl uence of money has so corrupted
our political process that our elections now have the appearance of being
purchased by the highest bidder, while the concerns of most hardworking,
tax paying, people go unnoticed.
At The Imagine Liberty Campaign I am running as an independent
candidate, not affi liated with any party, and we are not asking for or
accepting donations because government should represent all people, not
just those individuals and groups who are buying infl uence.
On our website you can fi nd the answers to the questions that motivate
our campaign. The cause of liberty is great because it entrusts people
to make their own decisions about how they choose to live their life and
it diminishes the power by which some try to use government to enforce
their expectations and wants upon others. The cause of liberty is great
because it takes control away from the parties and the powerful and gives
control back to the people.
We will be told again this year, as always, that this year’s election is too
important to “waste our vote.” I suggest, however, that the most powerful
vote you could cast, this year, would be to break the cycle of control and
have The Courage to Think Independent.

Community Service: Food Bank, community Garden
Statement: My name is Javier O. Lopez, and I believe that all humans are
good by nature. It takes a lot of hard work to turn bad. Here in Washington
we must fi nd good people to govern, we need to fulfi ll our destiny of
justice and equality. I believe the time has come to speak of kindness and
love. Those who speak of despair are practitioners of hate. They should
keep away from our highways, from our homes, from us. We need to
recognize that all humans can be of service, but don’t let them become
rulers of our state because they will make you suffer; they will make your
children and grandchildren debtors of their deeds.
Dear friends, dear Washingtonians keep commonsense, guard it with your
life make sure you use it in this election for it may be the most important
election of your life.
As for me I only regret having one life to give to my country and it has
already been given to the people. The road to the heart is faith and good
works, riches can be stolen, but the riches of the heart will be yours
forever and ever and keep in mind that double standards are the only
tools they have and their deceit is without comfort, faith or value.
If there is righteousness in the heart there will be strength in the character.
If there is beauty there is harmony in the home. There will be order in the
nation and there will be peace in the world, but only if people stop taking
advantage of you.
For example your present governor has given herself a raise while the
nation is facing bankruptcy.
Vote for Javier O. Lopez and I will give my salary back to the taxpayers.

Worked for fi ve years at Microsoft (contractor
1995 - 2000) and helped start Washington’s
fi rst online high school.
Education: M.B.A. University of Washington, B.A. Whitman College, Lake
Washington High School.
Community Service: Bill and his wife Kristin are active in their
community and their children’s lives. Over the years, along with serving
on boards of 4Culture, Kirkland Boys and Girls Club, and Cascade Land
Conservancy, Bill has also coached his daughter’s soccer team and
helped his son’s lacrosse club build new sports fi elds.
Statement: Bill Finkbeiner knows the gridlock and partisan bickering
in our State’s Capitol is unacceptable. As the Lieutenant Governor, Bill
Finkbeiner will work with both political parties to encourage a more
cooperative, less partisan, and less lobbyist-infl uenced government.
Bill Finkbeiner has the experience to succeed. He served 14 years in
the Legislature, including a term as Senate Majority Leader, before
returning to private business. Now, he’s bringing his business and political
experience forward to push change through the marbled halls of the
Capitol.
Some of the reforms are simple, like getting rid of the aisle that separates
Republicans and Democrats on the fl oor of the Senate. Other changes –
reducing the number of partisan staff and limiting the infl uence of lobbyists
– are more complicated; but all will make Olympia more open to citizens
and less beholden to special interests.
Bill Finkbeiner has won support from both Democrats and Republicans.
His endorsements include: Rob McKenna, Cathy McMorris Rodgers,
Dino Rossi, Slade Gorton, Sam Reed, Washington Conservation Voters,
NARAL, Michael Heavey and Larry Springer. Bill is a lifelong Washington
resident. He and his wife Kristin (co-founder of MomsRising) and their two
children live in Kirkland.

James Robert Deal
(States No Party Preference)
Elected Experience: Precinct committee
person while in law school. No previous
ambition for higher offi ce.
Other Professional Experience: Attorney
since 1978, helping clients modify their
mortgages and doing environmental law on a
pro bono basis as president of www.FluorideClass-Action.com.
Education: Western Washington University, B.A., M.Ed.; Anglican
Theological College at UBC; University of Washington, J.D.
Community Service: A leader in the safe water movement. Health
educator and author of a foodways book on nutrition, health, and the
history of diet.
Statement: Many water districts add an industrial grade of fl uoride to
drinking water – fl uorosilicic acid. It contains lead and arsenic and leaches
large amounts of lead from pipes. The body excretes these chemicals
poorly; they accumulate lifetime. They are most harmful to fetuses and
infants (reducing IQ), diabetics, those with arthritis and thyroid, kidney,
and heart disease. Blacks and Hispanics are impacted more than Whites.
Chemical companies earn a half billion dollar per year selling us this fi lth.
This racket must end.
Other Priorities: We are decapitalizing Washington, letting schools and
infrastructure decline. Only the rich can pay more, and they should. We
need a tax on high incomes and large capital gains. Washington should
increase its minimum wage. Anything which can be grown organically
should be grown organically. GMO crops should be outlawed and GMO
foods labeled. Washington needs a master transportation plan and can do
more to reduce carbon emissions. We need stronger campaign fi nance
laws. Schools should have large, year-round gardens and serve more
vegetables and less sugar and fat.
I run to raise issues others avoid. I will hold preconstitutional conventions
around the state to study needed structural changes.

Mark Greene
(Prefers Democracy Indep. Party)
 Elected Experience: Like some of the most
renowned and respected American political
leaders upon taking offi ce, none, but I was
the Democratic nominee for U.S. Congress
(Alaska District) in 2000 and 2002. I am the
founder of the political organization the Party
of Commons (since 2006).
Other Professional Experience: Legal Assistant experience, including
free-lance businesses such as legal research in Minnesota during 1990’s.
USMC veteran; 1970’s.
Education: Inver Hills College, Inver Grove Heights, MN, A.A.S. Degree
received in 1990’s.
Community Service: Founder of Democracy in Election Process, an
organization that helps citizens with voter registration, civic affairs, and
legal forms (since 2004, originally Commoner Committee for Political
Affairs).
Statement: I’m endorsing Darcy Burner for Congress (1 st CD), because
she will protect Social Security and other basic anti-poverty programs,
be at least moderately anti-interventionist in her foreign policy outlook,
uphold the Constitution, and show independence, i.e., not letting party
bosses dictate to her.
The Common Man’s Candidate for Lieutenant Governor: I had to get
on the ballot by petition, because I don’t get funds from parties, special
interest groups, or from Establishment-types. After all, they realize that
I am very sincere in representing the common person’s interests, not
theirs.’ I’m a real democrat, though independent, not a fake.
The environment is of fundamental importance as everything from the
economy to morality relates to it. We shouldn’t fool with Mother Nature
recklessly, if at all, but since the government has done so, we have to
rectify the wrongs through everything from mandating labeling of GMO
food to phasing out nuclear energy.
Our state and national constitutions together are the fi rewall between
democracy and totalitarianism, as democracy, after all, is the respect
of differences of opinion that we have with one another, and shown by
certain essential functions such as voting. It’s a politician’s solemn duty to
uphold our constitutions.

Education: BA in Statesmanship, George Wythe University, 2010.

Journal editor at Quincy Valley Historical Society. Various volunteer
service positions through church.
Statement: Washington is a state of many voices. From the various tribes
of the First Nations, to the pioneers, to the immigrants from nearly every
country on planet Earth, Washington is culturally, ethically, and politically
diverse. Yet this diversity is not fully refl ected in our election system, nor
is our system as secure as it could be. My proposals are to eliminate the
primary, to eliminate any defi nition of major or minor party by the state, to
have ballot access rule applicable to all parties and independents equally,
to have each candidate representing a party be the endorsed candidate of
that party, to institute Voter ID, to end Mail-in Voting and return to precinct
voting and paper ballots with absentee ballots and provisional ballots
available, and to prevent the implementation of E-voting. These steps will
put Washington in the forefront of safe, secure, equal and open elections
where Washingtonians of all political persuasions will be assured that their
vote carry the same weight as all other votes and is handled in a manner
that protects their vote from hacking, loss or damage, and fraud.

Other Professional Experience: In the 23

performance audits. I’ve been a successful
executive and principle consultant in large professional services fi rms and
run business units for Fortune 50 fi rms. I’ve worked with major federal
agencies; non-profi ts; and innovative private sector businesses, large and
small.
Education: BBA, MBA, George Washington University.
Community Service: Elected to leadership in Church, youth
organizations, etc. Citizen activist focusing on good/open government
issues. Active charity fundraiser. Married 27 years; two children.
Statement: State auditor is a job for an independent professional, not a
politician. That’s why retiring state auditor Brian Sonntag says “...[Watkins]
is particularly well qualifi ed based on his experience and background to
advance the State Auditor’s Offi ce and be an independent advocate for
taxpayers.”
I have the judgment and real world experience to make sure we get a
dollar’s value from every dollar we pay in taxes. Since earning my MBA,
I’ve worked successfully for 23 years to make organizations faster, more
effective, and more effi cient – and we need more of that in Olympia.
My opponent is a professional politician who voted repeatedly to weaken
the auditor’s offi ce, massively increase state spending, and hike taxes.
Now, he’s asking you to trust him to audit and evaluate the very same
government programs he voted to create! That’s like asking a fox to watch
the henhouse.
We need government we can trust. Citizens won’t allow the legislature
to raise taxes: effi ciency and cost savings are the only way to fund our
shared priorities while rebuilding voter trust. As your state auditor, I pledge
to drive effi ciency and effectiveness; to limit fraud, waste, and abuse; and
defend and expand open, transparent government.

the independent voice we need to ensure state dollars are focused on the
right priorities. He’s unwavering in his work eliminating waste and holding
government accountable, ensuring we have transparent government. We
need his kind of leadership.”
Troy believes in fi scal integrity. Leading by example, he was the fi rst of
147 legislators to voluntarily cut his pay in the economic downturn. Troy is
the only candidate in this race to cut his pay and refuse all special session
reimbursement payments.
Troy believes our ability to focus on top priorities like education depends
on our ability to manage budgets responsibly. That’s why he voted to
uphold the will of the people ensuring lower class sizes, and uphold voterapproved initiatives fi ghting unfair tax increases. The News Tribune says,
“The state needs more of his fi scal prudence. Kelley brings a welcome
voice and small business perspective to the House and is strong on
veterans issues.” The Moderate Washingtonian said Troy supports “fi scal
responsibility but doesn’t waffl e and has stood up for basic fairness on
issues that matter.”
Hire Troy Kelley as your next State Auditor. Ensure our tax dollars are
spent wisely.

fi refi ghter for over thirty years
Statement: A lifelong Eastern Washington rancher and father of fi ve,
Peter Goldmark has restored integrity to the management of nearly 15
million acres of forest, agricultural land and water resources. Peter works
hard to maximize the potential for jobs, recreation, education, and wildlife
preservation throughout Washington.
Trained as a scientist, Peter understands the need to reduce our

Other Professional Experience: No
information submitted
Education: I grew up in Tacoma, Washington
on an ‘in city farm’. Had many animals and
allot of responsibility. Have always learned
from watching nature, and have connected to it’s soul my entire life. I
didn’t know at the time how much this love would grow. I attended the
University of Washington and graduated with a degree in business
administration. I had a “born again” experience a few years ago while
hiking in Zion National Park, Utah. And now I know my love and
connection to nature are my purpose. I believe nature is sacred. I am a
guardian of it.
Community Service: No information submitted
Statement: Zeitgeist Washingtonians! The following are destroying
our natural resources: The federal government and it’s many agencies,
multi-national corporations, lobbyists, and the politicians who are
overly infl uenced by them. I am the no-party candidate, and lifelong
Washingtonian, I am a lover of nature and my fellow man. I am not money,
or power motivated.
I believe climate change is real. The incumbent admitted our forests are
dying, but isn’t moving fast enough to reverse the trend. He has had 4
years, and not enough to show for it.
I will make clear-cutting of forests illegal on state and private land. I will
propose to legislature a “Tree Tax”. This tree tax will be used to fund our
school trust. Eventually, I will eliminate our fi nancial dependency to cut
timber on our public lands. This will help salmon runs, and also help Puget
Sound . A forest takes several hundred years to mature. We will run out of
trees before we run out of money.
We must protect our greatest asset, our natural resources. Ask yourself,
“is the status-quo working? Then visit zeitgeistmovie.com. There is a
solution. I will make it happen for us. I’m asking for your help.

Elected Experience: No information

Other Professional Experience: Farmer/
rancher, owner of Back Forty Farms, our
second-generation family farm; NFL player
1981 – 1989; Presidential appointee to
Washington State Committee of national Farm
Service Agency 2000-2008.
Education: Graduated from Connell High School; B.S in Political Science,
Portland State University.
Community Service: Connell High School Football Coach 1999-2009,
coaching teams that included my three sons (I also have one daughter
with my wife of 30 years, Kristi, and 2 grandchildren), and winning 2 state
championships; Charity Tournament Director, “Fighting Children’s Cancer”
2004-2010; Member, Washington State Farm Bureau.
Statement: In Washington, we depend on the land for food, homes,
business and recreation. But “We the People” also own millions of acres
held in trust for us. Revenues from those lands (now, more than $200
million) fi nance school construction and many county services. But the
state projections show that those revenues are likely to go down in
coming years.
But we can turn that around to protect our children’s’ future by generating
more revenues through sustainable uses of these properties.
I am a steward of the land-a second generation farmer in the
“breadbasket” known as the Columbia Basin, and an avid sportsman.
In order to be sustainable, I must farm the land to be as productive as
possible but at the same time regard all environmental concerns including
land/water quality, and preservation of wildlife.
Much of the public lands are located in areas that have had little “say” in
Olympia. My goal is to change that process. And I will run Department of
Natural Resources as a lean organization, watching over taxpayer dollars.
I’m a farmer who knows the land, the forests, the water and the wildlife. I’d
like to manage them for the citizens of Washington.

Statement: For the past three years I’ve had the privilege of being your
Superintendent of Public Instruction. I fi rst ran for this offi ce in 2008 to
reform education and bring new leadership to Olympia, and in a few
short years, we’ve made a lot of progress: We replaced the WASL with
a better, fairer system of testing, Enacted reforms to hold everyone in
education more accountable for student learning, and improved our ability
to improve or remove struggling teachers, Created cutting-edge programs
to prepare our kids for the jobs of the future by partnering with companies
like Microsoft and Boeing, And I have consistently led the fi ght in Olympia
for more education funding to meet our constitutional obligation to
Washington’s kids.
I am running for re-election because the work is not done. We must
continue to reform our schools in order to maintain high standards and
increase accountability. And we need to demand full funding of education
so our students have the tools and resources they need to get the worldclass education they deserve.
As a teacher, principal, and legislator I’ve always made our kids’ future the
highest priority.

our schools, we can work together to overcome obstacles. High-stakes
testing and charter schools will not help our students achieve. We need
a variety of assessment methods throughout the year to determine
what students are learning and struggling with. Our schools need to be
safe places, free from bullying with high quality STEM programs, visual/
performing arts, athletics, and vocational education, so students develop
a variety of skills to prepare them to be successful adults. Education is
the most important thing that we do as a civilization. Every dollar spent
educating our citizens decreases unemployment and use of other social
services and increases our quality of life and ability of our people to be
resilient during diffi cult times.

Statement: Every family should have the opportunity to take responsibility
for individualizing the public education of their own children. To that end, I
propose a new foundation for public education, of which the existing local
public school districts would be an unchanged part. This new foundation
would consist of:
Individual Student Trust Accounts - for all students, funded annually using
each student’s existing $10,000+ state education voucher. With approval,
each student’s parents may spend these accumulating funds at any
Registered Public Education Program(s) of their choice. A Registered
Public Education Program would be any educational program, regardless
of ownership, which: accepts only trust funds as tuition, i.e. “free”; fi lls
at least 80% of its openings without admission qualifi cation, i.e. “open
enrollment”; permits no organized devotional instruction or activities; and
publishes measurable educational and behavioral goals for its students.
Students not achieving these goals may be dismissed.
Neighborhood Education Districts - three locally elected trustees will
oversee the educational progress of 50 to 200 participating neighborhood
students. The trustees must approve parental education choices for
students passing applicable WASL tests.
Community Facility Districts - locally elected, will own, operate and
maintain all public facilities. Life-cycle maintenance funds will be included
in the original bond funding.

be outstanding by parents of students 2. Full state funding of education,
accompanied by a ban on special school levies for operations, and
elimination of state business taxes. 3. Establishment of a three-level high
school diploma system: minimum, basic, and advanced. 4. Revision of
our state testing system, in order to eliminate some important fl aws that it
has. 5. Promotion of the methods of teaching that will improve students’

sovereignty is being undermined; Sexual anarchy is being promoted
by some of our most trusted institutions; Our children are not learning
their rights and responsibilities as citizens of a constitutional republic;
The federal government is usurping more and more power from local
government; The morale and combat effectiveness of our military is
being undermined by continual involvement in no-win wars; Religious
liberty is being suppressed at the same time Islamic mosques that
promote terrorism are not being monitored or controlled; Our media are
at best derelict in not keeping us informed on important issues, instead
keeping us occupied with the trivial and mundane; Judges have usurped
legislative authority and in some instances suppressed our Constitutional
liberty, thus changing our republic into an oligarchy; The EPA is imposing
regulations to abolish rural private property ownership and undermine our
economy.

Statement: Ex-Congressman Kriedler has been our State’s Insurance
Commissioner for 11 years. It’s time for a change. Over the past seven
years annual healthcare premiums increased 50% and employee share
of premiums increased by 63%. If premium trends continue the average
premium for family healthcare coverage will rise 72 percent by 2020.
Our State Insurance Commissioner’s system for regulating private
insurance companies is outdated. It stifl es and limits competition. Access
of affordable insurance can be expanded through smarter regulations.
Unfair underwriting practices must be stopped to elminate discrimination.
I will present a series of remedies to shortcomings of so-called “healthcare
reform” to restore choice and increase market availability. I will provide
leadership for enabling group purchasing of prescription drugs in this state
to lower healthcare coverage costs and reduce Co-pays. State tort laws
must be reformed to address rising costs to medical care providers in
order to make treatment affordable.
With my four decades of experience as an independent insurance
broker serving Seattle’s commercial insurance needs, I know how to get

Scott Reilly
(Prefers Republican Party)
Elected Experience: I am not a professional
politician.
Other Professional Experience: President/
Owner Walls Training, Inc., since 1989 I
have trained 35,000 Northwest residents in
insurance
Education: University of Washington, BA,
History
Community Service: Life long resident of the state. I volunteer on behalf
of a variety of community activities and events
Statement: It’s time for a new Insurance Commissioner. Over the last
16 years politicians have run this offi ce and we now have fewer choices
and costs have skyrocketed. I will cut red tape, bureaucracy and reduce
the mandates insurance providers face which keep competing insurance
products out of Washington that are available in neighboring states.
I will reform the Insurance Commissioner’s offi ce as well. Staff has
increased by 35%, to 225, with a budget of $115 million per year. The
result: insurance providers are forced to spend your premium dollars
complying with burdensome and unnecessary paperwork rather than
paying claims.
I have 35 years experience in the insurance industry at every level. I
have trained tens of thousands of your neighbors to be ethical, honest
consumer advocates. I will commit to a performance audit of the offi ce
and to bring small business effi ciency and effectiveness to the job; I will
always put consumers fi rst.
We spend 20% of our income on Insurance; let’s get the politicians out
of the industry. Vote for Scott Reilly for Washington State Insurance
Commissioner

(Prefers Democratic Party)
Elected Experience: This is my fi rst run for
elected offi ce. I will bring a fresh perspective
and a strong voice to break through the
partisan gridlock in Olympia.
Other Professional Experience: Small
Business Owner, Roscoe’s Ranch – voted

Association, former Director; 2nd Chance Rescue, Board of Directors; and

Statement: It’s time for the 1st district to have a citizen leader
representing them in the Senate instead of a career politician. I am an
energetic leader who is fi ghting for our citizens rather than special interest
groups. I am a proven business leader offering new solutions to today’s
challenges.
Small Business Owner I know what it takes to create jobs and economic
development. 53% of private sector jobs in this state are created by small
businesses. That is where we need to focus our efforts.
Active PTA Dad I have seen up-close how we fail to support our teachers
and children. Research shows the most impactful thing we can do
in education is ensure a highly qualifi ed teacher in every classroom.
We need more innovation, less bureaucracy and adequate funding to
ensure all our children get a quality education. I am pleased to have the
endorsement of Democrats for Education Reform.
Effi cient Government I have experience helping businesses and
organizations run more effi ciently. If state agencies operated 2% more
effi ciently, by adopting management techniques proven to work in the
private sector, we could save $1.4 billion per budget cycle to direct
towards education. I respectfully ask for your vote.

Statement: Olympia politicians claim to have reformed education. They
have not. For decades, the Constitutional mandate to provide our children
with funding for their education has been ignored. We need our legislature
to stop failing our kids and families and start representing people instead
of special interests.
I am honored to have served the community for fi ve years on the
Northshore School Board. As a school director I provide stable fi scal
management placing students and taxpayers fi rst. Under my direction,
the school board enacted new goals focused on measurable student
achievement providing accountability for student success.
Olympia needs effective leadership that values people over special
interest dollars. I understand the issues we face and bring the perspective
of a teacher, board member, small business director and conservationist.
As a Senator, I will keep my independent voice and work for the people
in the 1st Legislative District as I have for the students of Northshore. My
top priorities are education funding & reform, balancing the budget without
special sessions and encouraging a business friendly state that maintains
our natural resources. Endorsed by: Rob McKenna, League of Education

a consequence, thousands of teachers have been fi red and public
safety budgets have been slashed while taxes on the rest of us have
skyrocketed.

doing, but I’m learning, quickly. I know I can fulfi ll the duties of elected
offi ce. I know we can fi nd common ground in order to come together to
create a future that leaves the seventh generation in a better place.

years ago, I ran on a platform of strong support for our schools, safer

Senator to continue to work on the issues we care about.
In Olympia, my record speaks for itself; I have sponsored and passed
legislation to increase prison terms for those who kill others while driving
under the infl uence, I have allowed principals, teachers, and staff the
ability to know if a juvenile sex offender is attending their school in order
to protect our children, and have worked to help those who are victims of
domestic violence by lengthening prison terms for serial abusers.
I have supported transportation budgets to make our highways safer
and less congested, I have fought to protect our local schools and rural
hospitals from losing additional state funding, and I have introduced
innovative ideas to create jobs, try to bring the cost down on prescription
drugs, and cap credit card interest rates.
Most importantly, I am known as a legislator who cares for those he
serves. Your vote would honor me.

solutions that work in the real world.
There are still too many of us without work. Too many families losing their

of repair. There is still too much special interest money infl uencing the
debate in the Legislature. We deserve better. We can do better.
I’m not interested in going to Olympia to work for special interests. I’ve got
your back- not theirs. I’m not interested in doing things the same old way
– engaging in rigid ideological battles and the ”public be damned”. Look
where that path led us.
It is time for a new direction, new leadership. Leadership that knows the
benefi ts of true democracy rise from the ground up, not the top down.
New leadership that stands up for people struggling to secure a better
future for themselves and their families. New leadership for the 39th. New
leadership that has your back.

Other Professional Experience: Rob
served sixteen years in the Army where he
became a Platoon Sergeant, and has been
in Law Enforcement for fi fteen years. He is
currently a Financial Crimes Detective with
the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Offi ce. Rob is a former member of the
Snohomish County HSD: Alcohol/Other Drugs Advisory Board, and the
Snohomish County DUI Task Force.
Education: Rob attended Meadowdale High School in Edmonds, and
later graduated from Everett Community College with Honors.
Community Service: Rob enjoys being involved in youth programs; he
is a head coach and a member on the Stanwood-Camano Youth Football
League board.
Statement: Washington is one of the most regulated states; its
businesses pay some of the highest taxes. Rob believes this has to
change if we are going to see real job growth and economic development.
This can be achieved by limiting business regulations, lowering taxes
and lowering fees. We must work to reduce the overall size of state
government by allowing competition in privatizing certain state delivered
services.

independently study the issues to determine if it will fairly serve the public,
and if it will actually accomplish that purpose.

Statement: I’m running because east side legislators have abetted East

that will be a disaster for the entire east side. ST has lied for years about
the capacity of a light rail system with a four-car train every 7 minutes.
They’ve ignored the fact even this limited capacity won’t be accessible to
the vast majority of cross-lake commuters. They lied to a judge claiming
the center roadway could be used for light rail even though their own

reductions. With your support I will continue to emphasize a strong, fullyfunded education system, balanced state budgets, and work to ensure the

adequately stating their reasons.

court for 12 years. His experience includes constitutional law, land use,

companies, municipalities, and government. Among his most reported

parents challenging the 2009 Seattle School Closures and student

could not afford an attorney.
Scott says: “It’s time to shake up the Supreme Court with people who
have more depth of legal experience than they have an agenda.”

Statement: The Washington Supreme Court is often a citizen’s Court of
last resort and has the fi nal say on issues of Washington law. The U.S.
Constitution and Washington State’s Constitution are the ultimate laws
upon which decisions must be made. The Constitution should not be a
living, breathing document that changes with the whims of the Court in
response to politics or popular demand. The Constitution is the bedrock
when deciding cases. Judges should be elected without infl uence from a
political party or special interest group. Voters should not settle for a judge
who has been appointed by the most partisan offi ce of the State. Nor
should a judicial candidate be allowed to purchase an election through
contributions from special interest groups and/or attorneys whose cases
could be the subject of that Judge’s rulings. As a Supreme Court justice,
I will insure fundamental constitutional principals are not offended or
altered for the sake of accommodating prevailing popular sentiment. I
am not afraid to challenge prior case law that misapplies fundamental
constitutional principals and rights. My tenure in the Supreme Court will
be one free of special interest associations or the politics that can call into
question Judge’s impartiality.

Richard B. Sanders
Legal/Judicial Experience: I served on the
Supreme Court until 2011, fi rst elected in
1995; and reelected in 1998 and 2004. I wrote
more opinions than any other current Justice.
Before that, I practiced law for 26 years. I
also served as an adjunct professor teaching
appellate advocacy at the UW School of Law,
and guest lectured on state constitutional law
at Seattle University.
Other Professional Experience: I am an Eagle Scout and played for the
University of Washington in the Rose Bowl. (French horn!)
Education: B.S. and J.D., University of Washington
Community Service: I frequently lectured and wrote many legal articles
and opinion pieces explaining our constitutional rights.
Statement: Why has Justice Tom Chambers endorsed Richard Sanders
to take his seat on the Court? Because he knows Richard is a person of
unquestioned integrity, devoted to protecting the rights of all citizens.
Article 1, Section 1 of our constitution states: “governments...are
established to protect and maintain individual rights.” I believe that’s also
the job description of a Supreme Court Justice: we must look out for the
“little guy” and protect citizen rights. Sometimes this makes me seem
conservative, as when I support property rights, and sometimes it makes
me seem liberal, as when I fi ght for free speech and personal rights to
privacy. But I am consistent: we have rights the government must not
violate.
Thomas Jefferson said the God who gave us life gave us liberty as

Statement: Thank you for the privilege of serving on the Court of Appeals
for the past 14 years.
Your right of appeal to a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals is a
critical part of the safety net that protects our rights. The large volume of
cases and tremendous variety of civil and criminal issues makes the job
very challenging. My experience while a lawyer in private practice and
during 16 years in the legislature prepared me well for the breadth of
issues. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with the other members of the
court and wrestling with those challenges to make just decisions and to
write good opinions.
I believe a judge should serve the community in ways beyond the
decisions made on the bench. I work hard on court budget matters
and participate actively in judicial administration. I remain committed to
making information about the law more accessible to the public through
the “lawforwa.org” website. And, I will continue to promote awareness of
your civic rights and responsibilities through the Council on Public Legal
Education.
I ask for your vote of confi dence and the opportunity to serve you for
another term.

cases, from divorces to child custody disputes, evictions and other

cases. As an experienced civil and criminal law litigator, I have experience
working with domestic violence victims, as well as those accused of

enforcement is accountable for its actions.

Judge Position No. 46
104 King County
Full text of Ordinance No. 17304
AN ORDINANCE providing for the submission to the qualifi ed electors of
King County at a special election to be held in King County on August 7,
2012, of a proposition authorizing a property tax levy in excess of the levy
limitation contained in chapter 84.55 RCW for a consecutive nine year period
at fi rst year rate of not more than $0.07 per one th ousand dollars of assessed
valuation, to fund capital costs of replacing the children and family justice
center located at 12th Avenue and East Alder Street in Seattle.
SECTION 1. Findings:
 A. Public safety is a fundamental purpose of government.
 B. A strong criminal justice system is necessary to maintain safe and
livable communities.
 C. Under Washington state law, counties provide many regional and
local criminal justice functions, including police protection, the incarceration
of offenders, court services, and the prosecution and defense services of
defendants.
 D. The children and family justice center (“CFJC”) facility at 12th
Avenue and East Alder Street in downtown Seattle serves the justice needs
of King County youth and families.
 E. The CFJC is in a state of disrepair and has reached the end of its
useful life. The costs of maintaining the buildings have become untenable
with over twenty million dollars in needed maintenance costs alone. The
facility is in need of replacement to ensure the continuing justice services for
King County children and families and to meet the demands of population
growth in future years.
 F. The superior court has undertaken long range planning efforts for
the provision of juvenile and family justice services and has completed both
a Targeted Operational Master Plan (“TOMP”) and a Targeted Facilities
Master Plan (“TFMP”) which recommended replacement of the CFJC and
improvements to the facilities to meet future demand.
 G. Planning efforts have also determined that replacement of the
detention facilities with a modern design will allow the county to optimize
operations to reduce operational costs and avoid necessary major
maintenance expenses on the existing facilities. Additionally, relocating the
placement of detention facilities on the site will maximize the residual value of
the remaining land.
 H. Current funding for criminal justice is limited and insuffi cient to
provide King County residents with the level of services needed to build and
maintain safe and strong communities and to all make the necessary updates
to criminal justice capital facilities, including the CFJC.
 I. To counter this shortfall and a general lack of funding for county
government, King County has aggressively worked to reduce expenditures
by consolidating departments and functions, reducing labor costs and
eliminating positions and programs.
 J. To save taxpayer dollars and have the greatest possible impact on
those in need, King County makes substantial investments in prevention
and intervention efforts that reduce criminal justice involvement and costs,
including job readiness, employment services and ending homelessness, in
conjunction with funding traditional criminal justice services.
 K. To contain costs and bring growth in revenues and expenditures
into equilibrium, King County has continued to fi nd effi ciencies and capitalize
on productivity gains through the better use of technology, better program
management and performance measurement.
 L. King County has also worked to obtain additional revenue tools from
the state Legislature to offset the structural funding problem facing King and
all other Washington state counties. However, these changes have not been
suffi cient to solve the county’s projected revenue shortfalls.
 M. The county’s projected future defi cits threaten important criminal
justice and other essential government functions.
 N. The county council hereby fi nds that essential public health and
safety services provided by the CFJC are of general benefi t to all of the
residents of King County. To maintain King County’s ability to continue to
provide services at a facility on the current site of the CJFC, the county
council fi nds that the best interests of all of the residents of the county require
the county to undertake a replacement project for the facility.
 O. The county council further fi nds that it is appropriate to ask the
voters to fund the replacement of this essential criminal justice facility through
a nine-year $0.07 property tax levy.
SECTION 2. Defi nitions. The defi nitions in this section apply
throughout this ordinance unless the context clearly require otherwise.
 A. “Children and family justice center replacement project” means
a capital project or series of capital projects to design, remodel, construct
and equip facilities for juvenile justice and family law services, including but
not limited to replacement of the Alder wing, tower, detention facilities, and
associated parking facilities located at the children and family justice center
necessary to replace and expand the existing county facilities located at 12th
and Alder in Seattle.
 B. “Capital costs” includes the costs of architectural, engineering, legal
and other consulting services, inspection and testing, administrative and
relocation expenses, site improvement, demolition, on and off-site utilities,
related improvements and other costs incurred incident to the design,
remodeling, construction and equipping of the children and family justice
center replacement project and its fi nancing, including the incidental costs
and costs related to the sale, issuance and delivery of the bonds. However,
“capital costs” shall not include the costs of maintenance or operations.
SECTION 3. Levy submittal. To provide necessary funds for the
capital costs for design, remodeling, construction and equipping of the
children and family justice center replacement project, the county council
shall submit to the qualifi ed electors of the county a proposition authorizing a
regular property tax levy in excess of the levy limitation contained in chapter
84.55 RCW for nine consecutive years, commencing in 2012, with collection
beginning in 2013, at a rate in the fi rst year not to $0.07 per one thousand
dollars of assessed value. In accordance with RCW 84.55.050, this levy
shall be a regular property tax levy, subject to the statutory rate limit of RCW
84.52.043
SECTION 4. Project description.
 A. The children and family justice center replacement project will
replace and expand of the Alder Tower, Alder Wing, detention facilities and
associated parking facilities of the existing facility located at 12th and Alder in
Seattle. The exact project specifi cations shall be determined by the county
council.
 B. The council estimates that the capital costs of design, remodeling,
construction and equipping of the children and family justice center
replacement project will be in the range of two hundred to two hundred ten
million dollars.
SECTION 5. Deposit of levy proceeds. If approved by the voters, the
levy proceeds shall be deposited in a fi rst tier fund that shall be established
by the council upon voter approval of the ballot measure. Proceeds from the
fund shall be used solely for any eligible purpose identifi ed in section 6 of this
ordinance.
SECTION 6. Eligible expenditures. If approved by the qualifi ed
electors of the county, the levy proceeds shall be used only for capital costs
for the children and family justice center replacement project.
SECTION 7. Call for special election. In accordance with RCW
29A.04.321, the King County council hereby calls for a special election to be
held in conjunction with the general election on August 7, 2012. The director
of elections shall cause notice to be given of this ordinance in accordance
with the state constitution and general law and to submit to the qualifi ed
electors of the county, at the said special county election, the proposition 
King County 105

hereinafter set forth. The clerk of the council shall certify that proposition
to the director of elections, in substantially the following form, with such
additions, deletions or modifi cations as may be required for the proposition
listed below by the prosecuting attorney:
PROPOSITION 1: The King County council has passed Ordinance
17304 concerning funding for a replacement facility for the Children and
Family Justice Center. This proposition would authorize King County
to levy an additional property tax to provide funding for capital costs to
replace the Children and Family Justice Center, which serves the justice
needs of children and families. It would authorize King County to levy an
additional regular property tax of $0.07 per $1,000 of assessed valuation
for collection in 2013. The 2013 levy amount would become the base upon
which levy increases would be computed for each of the eight succeeding
years, all as provided in Ordinance 17304. Should this proposition be:
Approved? ________
Rejected? ________
SECTION 8. Energy effi ciency.
 A. If the proposition in section 6 of this ordinance is approved by the
voters, then, before requesting construction funds, the executive will submit
to the council a report on alternatives for heating and cooling the new
facility. The report shall contain, at a minimum:
 1. Options for heating and cooling the building;
 2. A discussion of the operating, maintenance and equipment
replacement costs for the various options;
 3. A discussion of the greenhouse gas contributions of the various
options;
 4. A discussion of how each option achieves the goals established
by the Seattle 2030 district, of which king county is a participating member;
 5. A discussion of any approved city of Seattle district energy project
that might encompass the children and family justice center.
 B. The executive must transmit the report required to be submitted by
this section in the form of a paper original and an electronic copy with the
clerk of the council, who shall retain the original and provide an electronic
copy to all councilmembers, the council chief of staff and the lead staff for
the budget and fi scal management committee or its successor.
SECTION 9. Severability. If any one or more of the provisions of
this ordinance shall be declared unconstitutional or invalid for any reason,
such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this
ordinance, the bonds or any short-term obligations issued in anticipation
thereof, and this ordinance, the bonds and any short-term obligations
issued in anticipation thereof shall be construed and enforced as if such
unconstitutional or invalid provisions had not been contained herein.
