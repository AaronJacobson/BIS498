August 7, 2012 Primary and Special Election
King County
Official Local Voters’ Pamphlet
2 A letter from the Director
Dear King County Voter:
The August primary and November general election represent the grand fi nale of our
four year election cycle in this Presidential election year.
In keeping with the drama and intensity of Presidential year elections, this election
cycle, national headlines have focused on stories about what some consider to be
safeguards and others deem barriers to voter registration and voting. Registered voter purges,
requirements to provide government issued photo identifi cation, redistricting with the appearance of
isolating minority communities, and screening requirements for voter registration are examples of programs
creating controversy. Naturally, advocacy groups have lined up on both sides of these actions. Department
of Justice law suits and Supreme Court rulings have reined in some states to address any semblance of
voter discrimination. A prominent issue related to these actions is citizenship, and the fear that non-citizens
are taking part in our political process.
Citizen concerns about voting rights and voter fraud have increased. Recently, King County’s Election
Department has received inquiries about the efforts we take to research the validity of citizenship for voter
registration in our county, offering the opportunity to clarify myths about voter fraud.
I’ve seen immigrant citizens avoid their legal right to vote due to fears brought with them from their former
place of citizenship. Reports and proof of non-citizens illegally invading the ballot box are extremely rare.
Voter registration in Washington requires signing the required oath attesting that you meet the legal
qualifi cations. You are attesting to the fact that you are a citizen of the U.S. and at least 18. You are also
declaring you are not under the authority of Department of Corrections and have not been disqualifi ed from
voting due to a court order. Registering to vote and voting without meeting these qualifi cations constitutes
a violation of the law and is subject to prosecution. A registered voter or the prosecuting attorney has the
right to challenge a voter’s registration status. Having served as an elections offi cial in this state for over
16 years, I have witnessed very few voter challenges, and very rarely seen any challenges confi rmed as
voter fraud.
Successful challenges for fraud across the country also remain remarkably rare. Still, those states seeking
to impose voting restrictions cite voter fraud as the reason.
In Washington, every citizen age 18 or older meeting the legal requirements to vote are encouraged to
register and vote. King County Elections does not conduct background checks on voters or question
qualifi cations unless a challenge has been fi led.
Be aware of registration and voting deadlines and do not miss your opportunity to vote in our historic
Presidential year elections.
Best Regards,
Sherril Huff
Voter registration deadlines

Reading the local
voters’ pamphlet
Why are there measures and candidates in the local
voters’ pamphlet that are not on my ballot?
Don’t worry, your ballot is correct.
The measures and races on your ballot refl ect the
districts in which you are registered to vote. The local
voters’ pamphlet may cover multiple districts and
include measures and races outside of your districts.
What is an explanatory statement?
An explanatory statement is prepared by each district’s
attorney stating the effect of the ballot measure if
passed into law.
How are committees in favor of or in opposition to
a measure formed?
Districts choosing to participate in a local voters’
pamphlet are responsible for appointing committee
members who agree to write statements.
The statements are a way to persuade voters to vote
for or against a measure. King County Elections is
not responsible for the content or accuracy of the
statements.
What is the order of candidates in the local voters’
pamphlet?
Candidates in the local voters’ pamphlet appear in the
order they will appear on the ballot.
Candidates are given word limits based upon the
number of registered voters within each district.

About the
Top 2 Primary
Washington uses a “Top 2” system for its
primary election. A Top 2 primary allows voters
to vote for any candidate running in each
race. The two candidates who receive the
most votes in the primary election advance to
the general election. A candidate must also
receive at least 1% of the votes cast in that
race to advance to the general election.
The Top 2 primary applies to partisan offi ces.
It does not apply to elections for Precinct
Committee Offi cers. While there are some
slight variations, elections for nonpartisan
offi ce, such as city council or judge, are
conducted in a similar manner to the Top 2
primary. Generally, the two candidates in a
nonpartisan race who receive the most votes
in the primary advance to the general election.
You may wonder why some offi ces don’t
appear on the primary ballot. When only
one or two candidates fi le for a nonpartisan
offi ce, there is no primary and the candidates
automatically advance to the general election.
For partisan offi ces and some judicial offi ces,
there is still a primary even if only one or two
candidates fi le.

Many homeowners already are struggling to meet fi nancial obligations and
don’t need another property tax increase but the Council is saying “yes” to
public employee unions and “no” to property tax relief. Don’t be fooled: if
the Council privatized some services now provided by county government,
revenue for capital improvements would be available. If voters continue
approving these levies, there’ll be more spending initiatives and more
Council demands for additional revenue to fund them.
Statement submitted by: John H. Shackleford
All nine members of the non-partisan King County Council voted
unanimously to send Prop. 1 to the voters. Public Safety and protecting
kids are NOT partisan issues. A new building will end wasteful repairs
and provide effi cient, compassionate service delivery—saving money and
lives. Children and families in King County deserve our support. Join with
Prosecutor Dan Satterburg, Presiding Judge Richard McDermott, former
Justice Bobbe Bridge and many more and VOTE YES for Prop. 1.
Statement submitted by: John McKay, Bobbe J. Bridge, and Estella Ortega
Anyone aspiring to become a homeowner should consider whether property
taxes now are so high that such ownership is problematic.The King County
Council nevertheless believes it needs more, not less, revenue during
diffi cult economic times and this request is its latest salvo in class warfare
waged for the benefi t of renters and the homeless, demographics relatively
unaffected by property tax increases. Again, the Council has declined to
propose a sales tax increase, opting instead for the property tax increase
it’s confi dent will pass because homeowners constitute less than half of
registered voters. Further, since the Council is indebted to public service
unions for the support which re-elects its members, there’s been no action
to reassign any governmental service to the private sector where it might be
delivered more economically.
Vote YES on Prop 1: YES FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES
The Children and Family Justice Center (“CFJC”) is where children and
families go in times of crisis: child abuse and neglect; foster care transition;
complex custody issues; juvenile offenses and truancy cases.
A growing population and economic diffi culties mean more kids and families
need care and protection, but current facilities are dangerously outdated and
failing our children. Brown water fl ows from drinking fountains, entire sections
are unusable, and electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems are beyond repair.
Financial reviews state that replacement—not temporary fi xes—is the least
expensive long-term solution.
Despite decrepit conditions, our court is leading in innovations for juvenile and
family justice. The new CFJC will better serve families and child advocates by
co-locating services like medical treatment, counseling, and placement. The
new design will improve safety, privacy and dignity. Combining services will
save millions in duplicative service providers and offi ces.
We cannot wait any longer. For less than $25/year for an average
household—less than 50¢/week—we can give hope to at risk kids and
families. A unanimous County Council, Dow Constantine, the Kent and
Auburn Mayors, and Bellevue Reporter agree - vote YES on Prop 1.
If approved by voters, Proposition 1 would authorize King County
to levy an additional regular property tax to fund the capital costs
of replacing and expanding the Children and Family Justice Center
located at 12th Avenue and East Alder Street in Seattle. The levy
would be authorized for a nine-year period with collection beginning
in 2013. In the fi rst year, the levy rate would be equal to or less
than seven cents ($0.07) per one thousand dollars ($1,000) of
assessed valuation on all taxable property within King County.
Annual increases for collection years 2014 through 2021 would be
governed by chapter 84.55 RCW, which limits the growth of the levy
amount to 1% per year.
The Children and Family Justice Center Replacement Project
includes a series of capital projects to design, remodel, construct,
and equip facilities for juvenile justice and family law services.
Capital projects include replacement of the Alder wing, Alder tower,
detention facilities, and associated parking facilities. Levy funds may
be used only for capital costs and incidental costs, including those
related to the sale, issuance and delivery of bonds. Levy funds may
not be used for the costs of maintenance and operations of the
facilities.
Proposition No. 1
Children and Family Services Center Capital Levy
The King County council passed Ordinance No. 17304
concerning a replacement facility for juvenile justice and
family law services. This proposition would authorize King
County to levy an additional property tax for nine years
to fund capital costs to replace the Children and Family
Justice Center, which serves the justice needs of children
and families. It would authorize King County to levy an
additional regular property tax of $0.07 per $1,000 of
assessed valuation for collection in 2013. Increases in the
following eight years would be subject to the limitations
in chapter 84.55 RCW, all as provided in Ordinance No.
17304. Should this proposition be:

an economic development consultant and
former diplomat who advised international
and Northwest fi rms. In 2007 Mike served
as an Economics Offi cer at the US
Embassy in Baghdad, earning commendations from General Petraeus
and Ambassador Crocker. In 2009 he worked on a State Departmentcontracted counternarcotics program in Afghanistan, helping farmers grow

Statement: Michael Baumgartner left a successful career in international
development to help his country in Iraq and Afghanistan. Then, he
challenged and defeated an entrenched incumbent and won election to
the State Senate.
As a State Senator, Michael has shown he can work with both parties to
fi nd pragmatic solutions, balance budgets, reform government spending
and improve education. He sponsored legislation to protect higher
education funding and prevent further cutbacks.
Michael has the background, experience, and common sense necessary
to be an outstanding U.S. Senator. He is endorsed by Senator Slade
Gorton, Attorney General Rob McKenna, Congresswoman Cathy
McMorris Rodgers, Secretary of State Sam Reed, and Representative
Cary Condotta. More important, Michael is supported by hundreds of
Washington small business owners, veterans, and educators. Michael and
his wife Eleanor have a young son, Conrad, and are expecting another
child this year.
“I love Washington. I was born and raised here, the son of two educators.
After studying at WSU and Harvard, my economic development career
took me around the world. Washington’s wonderful, natural environment
and friendly, innovative people make it the best place in the world.
“Now, America is struggling. In the past 12 years, reckless spending and
poorly planned wars have helped double the national debt and millions
don’t have jobs. Too many politicians care more about special interests
than fi nding solutions. The US Senate hasn’t passed a budget in more
than three years. DC is broken.
“I want to help turn things around, here and overseas. I’ve seen fi rsthand
the progress our troops have made in Afghanistan against amazing odds.
Now it’s time to bring them home and concentrate on rebuilding our
economy. Our children should inherit a thriving America - not one in debt
and decline. I’d be honored to have your vote. We’ve got work to do.”

Statement: The kids and grandkids inheritance $15,700,000,000,000
($15.7 trillion)DEBT. When the incumbent fi rst went to Washington D.C.
the National Debt was $4,188,092,106,183. Over the last 30 years the
people of the United States have paid $9,500,000,000,000 (9.5 trillion)
interest (usury) on this Debt; last year $454,000,000,000 was spent
covering interest. When the Federal Reserve Bank doubles the interest
rates, payment will double from $454 Billion to $908 Billion.
We have a serious problem; the postponement of dealing with this over
the years has left the United States in a precarious fi nancial situation.
I don’t have a SuperPac or millions of dollars; just Voters pamphlets,
website and hopefully your involvement, (facebook, twitter, dialog with
friends and neighbors) the only possible way to stop this train-wreck.
“As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public
credit. One method of preserving it is, to use it as sparingly as possible...”
President Washington
Potholes, bridges and other infrastructure could have been repaired had
the public credit been cherished instead of squandered.
“I place economy among the fi rst and most important virtues, and
public debt as the greatest of dangers to be feared. To preserve our
independence, we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. If
we run into such debt, we must be taxed in our meat and drink, in our
necessities and in our comforts, in our labor and in our amusements. If we
can prevent the government from wasting the labor of the people, under
the pretense of caring for them, they will be happy,” President Jefferson
We, the borrowers, are slaves to the lenders; austerity measures that
will be forced on U.S. will pale in comparison to what has been forced on
Greece, if this fi nancial mess continues. Information and offered solutions,

Education: No information submitted
Community Service: As a direct result of
Will’s community service, Will believes the number one issue in the 2012
U.S. Senate election should be the illegal and unethical election practices
used by Washington Secretary of State Sam Reed. Fact: Secretary of
State Reed is in the business of manipulating State primary elections.
How? Fact: One way is to illegally and/or unethically manipulate/rig
information available to voters. How? Fact: Reed cancelled the entire
2010 and 2012 printed Washington State Primary Voters’ Pamphlets and
continues to hide information about how to appear in some counties local
Voters’ Pamphlet from some candidates.
Statement: I believe the number one issue in the 2012 U.S. Senate
election should be impeaching President Barack Obama specifi cally
for Obama’s decision to give America’s state of art military spy drone
technology to Iran (and through Iran to China and Russia).
The 1979 Iranian Revolution; Fact: America backed the Shah of Iran.
Fact: The Shah was a ruthless dictator who murdered his people. Fact:
The Iranians revolted against the Shah. Fact:. The Iranians hated America
for supporting the Shah. Fact: The Iranians took American hostages. Fact:
In 1979, President Jimmy Carter ordered a raid to rescue the hostages,
but the operation failed when the Delta Force’s helicopter crashed. 9/11
Terrorist Attack
Fact: On September 11, 2001, 19 al-Qaeda members on a suicide
mission hijacked four airplanes and fl ew three of those planes into
the world trade center towers and the Pentagon; killing thousands of
Americans. Fact: The leader of al-Qaeda was Osama bin Laden. Mr.
Commander In Chief
Fact: In November 2008, Obama was elected President and Commander
in Chief. Bye-bye Bin Laden Fact: In 2011, Obama ordered the raid that
killed Osama bin Laden. Fact: Obama ordered the special operations
commander who organized the bin Laden raid to throw in two additional
helicopters for backup. (Good decision, since one of the assault
helicopters crashed outside bin Laden’s compound.)
Fact: Seal Team Six destroyed the damaged helicopter before leaving
Pakistan. Fact: Now, Iran wants a nuclear weapon.
Fact: Obama’s administration has been fl ying stealth spy drones over
Iran to monitor Iran’s nuclear program. Fact: One of the drones crashed
in Iran. Fact: Obama didn’t send military personnel into Iran to retrieve
the drone, and didn’t blow-up the drone by remote before Iran grabbed it.
Fact: Now Iran has our stealth spy drone and they are not giving it back.

Art Coday
(Prefers Republican Party)
Elected Experience: None
Other Professional Experience: Art spent
six years in biochemical and heart research.
As a medical doctor he does house calls
and nursing home care, mainly for Medicare
(seniors, permanently disabled), Medicaid
(very poor), and uninsured patients.
Education: Art graduated from the Lakeside School, the University of
Washington (B.S. in Cellular and Molecular Biology; with college honors,
magna cum laude), and Harvard Medical School (M.D.).
Community Service: Art volunteered at the Seattle Children’s Hospital
Summer Camp for six years, working with children with special medical
needs. He served on nonprofi t boards, including three years for the North
Seattle Christian School, as Treasurer and President.
Statement: As a doctor, I fi ght for my patients. As your senator, I will fi ght
for you.
Patient fi nancial hardship and insurance status do not stop me from
caring. To accept low reimbursements, I reduced cost by eliminating my
offi ce; now I make house calls. Effective healthcare reform is needed, so
let’s repeal the healthcare act my opponent supported; it harms Medicare
and Medicaid and raises cost. Let’s rebuild Medicare, Medicaid, and the
VHA for our seniors, poor, disabled, and veterans. In the private market,
let’s demand transparency, fairness, and competition so you’re in charge
of affordable care.
Cutting spending, balancing the budget, reducing debt, and ending
infl ation will repair our national credit and stabilize the economy. As
a small business owner, I know that easing regulatory burdens and
mandates, enacting favorable trade policies, and lowering energy costs
will stimulate the economy. This will restore the catastrophic loss of
prosperity and American jobs sustained throughout my opponent’s 12-
year tenure.
I will defend your rights, including your right to keep and bear arms,
the right to life, and property rights. I support traditional family values.
We must maintain the world’s fi nest military to achieve peace through
strength. We must take good care of our veterans and military personnel,
and have a foreign policy that’s confi dently pro-America and pro-liberty,
supports allies like Israel, and is fi rmly resolved to defeat terrorism. Border
security is vital. My opponent won’t challenge her party boss on numerous
issues, like transferring nuclear waste from Hanford to Yucca Mountain; I
will.
The contrast between the incumbent and me is sharp; the record, not the
rhetoric, proves this. I am passionate about America, and with the right
leadership, our children will have a bright future.
Thank you for your trust and your vote. Serving you will be an honor.

Community Service: Henry M. Jackson Foundation, Honorary Council
of Advisors; South Snohomish Chamber of Commerce, Former Board
Member; Mountlake Terrace Friends of the Library; Alderwood Rotary,
Former Board Member; Apollo Alliance, Founding Board Member
Statement: Congress is bogged down in partisanship and gridlock. But
Senator Maria Cantwell puts politics aside and does what’s right for our
state. Maria is focused on job creation and keeping America competitive in
the global economy - because she knows too many families are struggling
just to get by.
That’s why Maria is working to make sure Washington State remains
the hub of America’s aerospace industry. She fought unfair foreign
competition to help Boeing win the $35 billion Air Force contract that
could mean 11,000 jobs for our state. Now Maria is helping develop
apprenticeship and job training programs so we have a skilled workforce
for those jobs.
Maria’s fi ghting to increase Pell Grants and help middle class kids afford
college. She co-sponsored a bill giving returning veterans access to a
college education. She’s working to give laid-off workers and veterans
access to job training at community colleges so they can develop the skills
they need for new jobs.
To create opportunities for businesses to hire more workers, Maria voted
to cut taxes for small businesses and manufacturers while pushing banks
to loan to small businesses that want to grow. Maria recognizes that the
federal defi cit is a dagger pointed at the heart of our economy, so she’s
working to cut wasteful government spending. She is pushing to end
tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and instead provide
tax incentives for companies that create jobs here. And Maria is working
to develop Washington’s new clean energy industry, which will create
thousands of jobs across our state.
Maria kept her commitment to protect Social Security and Medicare,
fi ghting attempts by both parties to cut these vital programs.
Senator Maria Cantwell is focused on making life better for our families
and for the people of Washington State.

national partnership.
Community Service: No information submitted
Statement: Dear Voters, Please create jobs by defending and promoting
wealth. Defend a national Jobs and Wealth partnership. The pursuits
of consumption, profi ts, and wealth are incentives that build a beautiful,
proud civilization. Please un-sabotage our labor markets. Squeezed
between prices and the minimum wage, some employers quit. The
minimum wage destroys jobs and destroys employers. Prices, that we
don’t want to go higher, go higher to cover the cost of higher wages. Sales
slow. Higher average wages create higher prices, less profi t and job loss.
Prices must cover wages. But lower average wages create lower prices,
more purchasing, and jobs. We move towards a balanced economy of full
employment. Consumers buy more when prices go down. Jobs increase.
You students of economics should know that Supply and Demand sets
different, changing prices for different kinds of labor. You voters who
understand economics know that we should abolish the job-destroying,
employer-destroying minimum wage so that homeless and other troubled
people can get jobs and increase production. As the average cost-of-labor
goes up, jobs disappear. Recession returns. Reduce the average costof-labor and jobs return. As more workers increase production, the living
standard rises. In our exchange economy, we work for each other!
To bring back jobs, vote for candidates who understand economics and
profi t and are small spenders. Big spenders make government more
wasteful. Leaders who don’t understand the Science of Economics have a
big hole in their education. Year after year, they destroy jobs.

Statement: It’s said that in Missouri there’s a sign at the beginning of a
dirt road that tells drivers, “choose your rut carefully, because you’re going
to be in it for the next 20 miles.” Our District has been in the same old rut
for too long. It’s time to drive out of that rut and finally fulfill the promise
of equal opportunity for all. Andrew Hughes knows the problems our
community faces are not abstract; they’re personal.
Our tax code is unfair. Economic inequality is widespread. Students leave
college with massive debt and no hope of employment. Public schools
don’t guarantee equal education and our laws don’t guarantee equality
for all. Too many hardworking Americans have put life on hold as they
struggle to get by.
As a tax attorney, Andrew Hughes has the expertise to revise our tax
code and re-direct money to education, local infrastructure and social
programs. Andrew is prepared to serve the people of the 7 th District and
effectively fight for tax fairness, marriage equality, drug law reform, and
our shared progressive values.
Teaching at Cleveland High School, Andrew saw first hand how crucial
it is that the federal government help to fully fund public education.
Representing juvenile defendants and working with their families, Andrew
witnessed the dire need for resources to maintain social programs like
school mentoring and community health clinics. Working on our State’s
efforts to clean up nuclear waste at Hanford, Andrew recognized the
importance of building bridges between local and national government.
U.S. Congress is broken and desperately needs new energy, modern
ideas, and a renewed sense of urgency to get us out of this rut. It’s time to
realize the dream of opportunity for all. Vote for Andrew Hughes and help
elect a new, effective, and progressive voice to Congress!

Over 22 Years in Renewable Energy.
Community Service: none
Statement: I am running for Congress to promote green technology,
jobs advance AIDS research and the development of efficient methods of
transportation. We need fiscal responsibility.
Geothermal Power We have the technology today to make geothermal
energy a practical reality. Energy from the earth can be used to power
electrolysis machines that will split water into oxygen and hydrogen.
The oxygen can be combined with natural gas to produce an oxy-fuel
combustion. This will produce electricity without any harmful waste
products. Hydrogen and Carbon Dioxide can be made into methanol
and then converted into gasoline. This is both environmentally friendly
and frees us from overseas oil. Biomass Energy We produce over 1.2
billion tons of non food biomass each year. This can be conver into over
12 million barrels of fuel daily using environmentally friendly geothermal
power.
Run of River Power Hydroelectricity can be produce without harming fish
runs. Run of the river power system allow us to generate power without
the use of dams. Carbon Dioxide can be taken out of the atmosphere
and combined with hydrogen from the water to make methanonl and then
gasoline. This is carbon neutral and will produce jobs and clean energy.
Energy Efficient Vehicles Steam turbine electric engines technology can
be used to build cars that get 54.5 MPG. This technology can also use the
exhaust gases of military generators for addional power in Afghanistan
to power generators that will use the maximum use of the fuel. This will
reduce cost, and save both fuel and lives.
AIDS Vaccine The development and funding of an AIDS vaccine must
be a priority. Ultra violet light can be used to kill the AIDS virus take out
of white blood cells. The killed AIDS virus can be extrated and used to
develop a vaccine.

Statement: Excessive Debt, Unemployment, Spending and Taxes hold us
down, not help us up. Year after year, we hear talk without real results.
Re-electing the same old incumbents won’t fi x this.
My opponent’s had 24 years to lift these burdens and get Social
Security and Medicare securely reformed – instead he’s made them
worse and nearly bankrupt. Our national debt is six times higher, to
$139,000 /taxpayer. The best education is good and affordable -- instead,
student debts soar. The best social program is a job – instead, total
unemployment exceeds 20%. The economy and jobs stagnate with
over-regulation, waste, and anti-business policies. Spending skyrockets.
Massive bills pass unread. Tax system numbingly complex.
Had enough yet?
We need a representative to look beyond extreme partisanship and get
results for all of us and common interests, not special interests for few at
the cost of many. My political principles are nonpartisan and time-proven:
Individual Freedom; Responsible, restrained government; Free Enterprise;
and Ethics of Life, Liberty, Fair Treatment for All, and Accountability. I’ll
apply a common sense ‘N.E.E.D.’ test for legislation: Is it in our National
interest? Effi cient in cost? Effective in result? Dated to be measured,
amended or ended?
I get results. As a Seattle resident continuously since 1976, business
owner, and attorney successfully serving both plaintiff and defendant
clients for over 30 years (and winning every jury trial, but one), I’m
more in touch with our District, experienced in economic matters,
understand different views, and bring a proven record of excellent
results, with ‘real world’ skills in problem-solving, fact fi nding,
judgment, and legal knowledge. I pledge to apply these skills, as an
independent representative responsible to all of you, to help stop this
continuing neglect and get us real results. Please Support/ Contact:

Statement: All elections are important, but the choices we make in this
year’s contest are crucial for the future of our country. We face daunting
challenges in so many areas – and how we respond to them will set our
course for many years to come. The turmoil and uncertainty of the last few
years has taken a diffi cult toll on too many Americans. Now we must take
bold action to restore the vitality of our country and the promise of our
future. Representing Washington’s 7th District in the Congress is a great
privilege and a grave responsibility. I ask for your support now to continue
that work as a strong and thoughtful voice for progressive change.
I am eager to return to the Congress to tackle the momentous issues
before us. The landmark health care reform legislation enacted in 2010
must be implemented carefully to fulfi ll its promise of more and better care
for all Americans. We must, fi nally, provide the ongoing care needed by
our soldiers and veterans. Our economy is still stumbling, and millions of
Americans remain unemployed. And the current cost of gas underscores
our urgent need to recast our energy policies and practices to develop the
sustainable energy resources that will allow us to prosper in a changing
world.
We can solve these problems with determined effort and clear purpose.
I am committed to this effort and to the goals of a strong and productive
society: affordable housing; employment opportunity; fair and progressive
wages and taxation; reproductive choice; uncompromised civil rights and
liberties; and trade policies that respect workers’ rights and protect the
environment.
I invite you to review my record, and ask for your vote. Thank you for your
support.

Statement: Open up your favorite news site in your browser or mobile
app and you’re bound to see lots of repetition: Democrats versus
Republicans. Pro-choice versus pro-life. Gun control versus no controls.
More federal spending versus less. And on and on. You don’t see a lot of
news about things actually getting done, or how elected representatives in
Congress are managing to solve America’s toughest challenges in one of
its most diffi cult eras.
An April 2012 Gallup poll put Congress’ approval rating at a dismal 17%.
Regardless of whether you’re a Democrat, Republican, or Independent,
chances are good that you don’t approve of the job that your elected
representative is doing. I sure don’t. But year after year we continue to
elect a body of so-called leaders who let political ideology stand in the
way of achievable progress. Representatives who think that blaming the
other side and kicking the can down the road is a sustainable way of
managing the mess our country is in.
Every election you have a choice. This year, you can vote for the same
person-- and continue to worry about how your next social security check
is going to be funded, or how you’ll pay your medical bills if you get sick,
or how crowded your child’s classroom is going to be or whether or not
you’ll be able to afford college.
Or you can vote for me— someone who isn’t content to simply blame
Republicans or Democrats for an inability to get things done. A family man
who cares about implementing solutions for social issues like healthcare,
civil liberties, and education. A business professional who thinks about
innovative ways to create jobs and stimulate our economy. And a leader
who has the audacity and drive to build and execute a vision to restore
America’s promise.

Interpretation Analyst. In this role I made
substantial contributions to our country working within the intelligence
community during the Gulf War, the Iran/Iraq war, the Soviet Withdrawal
from Afghanistan, and numerous other arenas. This experience in
international policy defi nitively separates me from the other candidates.
Education: Social Science, Linfi eld College.
Community Service: Past Board member,Washington County (Oregon)
Democrats and Young Democrat Coordinator. Youth football coach and

Statement: I am running for the position to represent the residents of
the First Congressional District because I feel that this offi ce should be
held by a strong Democrat who will lead with integrity as a hard working
advocate for the people. My history of service in the Air Force and the
Democratic Party, combined with my proven management experience in
the private sector uniquely qualifi es me to serve in this position. I am very
excited and honored at the opportunity to serve my district, my state and
my country.
I recognize that this is only a one-month position and that I won’t be able
to change the world during my term. What I promise you though, is that I
will work hard for our district.
We must address the defi cit . Over the last 11 years, the defi cit has grown
at an alarming rate. We need to work on cutting spending in a sensible
manner that will reduce the defi cit while not harming the fragile economic
recovery.
Take care of our Veterans. A huge number of our young men and women
have been asked to serve over and above what has been expected in
recent times. Scores of soldiers, sailors and airmen have been sent back
for second, third, or even more tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. We must
take care of their needs as they transition back to civilian life, and ensure
that the physical and emotional wounds from their service are given the
best possible care.
Continue strengthening the economy. The economy is clearly in recovery.
We need to continue to strengthen the economy by making well thoughtout investments in our workforce.

Network, the Digital Learning Commons, and the King County Library
System Foundation. Co-Chair of Discovery Community School’s parent
group. Lives in Kirkland with husband and two stepchildren.
Statement: My mother. My father. My sister. My two sisters-in-law. Over
the last few years, they’ve all battled cancer. And one of my sisters-in-law
died.
There are many reasons why I’m running for Congress at this time
of great turmoil over the economy, spending, and the future of Social
Security and Medicare. But defending President Obama’s health care law
is my most personal reason. I don’t want an insurance company to ever
again be able to deny coverage for a pre-existing condition.
I’ve fought these battles before. As a state legislator, I passed a law
helping low-income women get breast cancer treatment. I reached across
party lines to support our schools and balance the budget. I worked
with biotech fi rms and companies like Boeing and Microsoft to provide
incentives for job growth.
At this time of partisan gridlock, no one will out-work me to make change
happen. The fi ght for health care reform - just like the fi ght for jobs, to
support our veterans, for a woman’s right to choose, to strengthen Social
Security and Medicare, and for a tax system that ensures the wealthiest
1% pay their fair share - is hard work, especially with a budget so far out
of balance. We cannot saddle our children with debt they can never repay.
As a small businesswoman raising a family in a suburban neighborhood
with kids in public school, I live all of these issues every day. Just like you
do. I share your priorities of investing in education, health care, and job
creation. I haven’t given up, and I hope you haven’t either. I ask for your
vote so we can change Congress together.

Statement: I was touched by America before I ever set foot in this great
country. Growing up in Nepal, I was fortunate to attend a wonderful
school that was partly funded by Americans. When I came here in 1988, I
knew education was the path to achieving the American Dream. I worked
several jobs and earned my college and graduate degrees. I founded a
technology company, giving me unique insight into the industry that is
critical to our region and essential to America’s global competitiveness.
I am disillusioned by the inability of Congress to address the pressing
economic and social challenges facing America. The professional
politicians stand in the way of fundamental change because they are
beholden to the special interests that benefi t from the status quo. I will
break the stranglehold lobbyists have on the system, and I am the only
candidate in this race who refuses to accept contributions from special
interest PACs.
I am determined to reform the tax code so the wealthiest pay their fair
share; dramatically cut military spending; balance the budget; invest in
world-class education; rebuild our crumbling infrastructure; protect Social
Security and Medicare; ensure funding for Planned Parenthood; expand
the use of clean energy; guarantee marriage equality; and ensure that
our trade agreements include environmental standards and provisions to
protect American jobs.
Too many politicians don’t have the courage to stand up and fi ght for real
progressive change. I am the only candidate in this race to take a stand
against the proposed Coal Terminal because of the environmental threat
to our region. I am not a professional politician and I am not beholden
to the special interests. If you give me a chance to serve, I will always
remain true to the progressive values of our community. Thank you for

this offi ce greatly, and this is not an ego trip. I am the only Veteran as a
candidate, the only one from Kitsap County, and over 65.
My political thinking is guided by the following persons. Disraeli said 200
years ago, “Great nations rise and fall. The people go from bondage
to spiritual truth, to great courage, from courage to liberty, from liberty
to abundance, from abundance to selfi shness, from selfi shness to
complacency, from complacency to apathy, from apathy to dependence,
from dependence back to bondage.” My fear is that we are three steps
away from bondage unless we do something about it. Ghandi recited
the “7 Blunders of the World” as “wealth without work, pleasure without
conscience, knowledge without morality, commerce without character,
science without humanity, worship without sacrifi ce, politics without
principle”. When asked will America survive, de Toqueville answered,
“Certainly, if it links itself to the eternals.” John Kennedy admonished,
“Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your
country.”
My theme for each is, “Is what I am doing in the public interest?”
Environment, fi nance, and excessive expectations are involved. We
cannot allow complacency for all have played a role in not linking us to the
eternals, and each must answer Kennedy. However, we must be diligent
to preserve our civil liberties.

Committee; past Board President Arlington Christian School; attends

Statement: John Koster grew up on a dairy farm in Snohomish County
where his parents instilled in him a strong work ethic, honesty, and
responsibility. They taught him the value of a dollar and to be loyal to his
family, his faith, his community, and his country.
An independent thinker and trusted leader, John is deeply concerned
that our children and grandchildren will not have the same opportunities
as his generation. As your representative in Congress, John will work
tirelessly to roll back runaway government growth and spending. He will
work to remove unnecessary regulatory encumbrances placed on small
businesses which have caused the economy to sour while double-digit
unemployment rates have become commonplace.
There are fundamental differences between John Koster and liberals in
Congress who believe they should continue to borrow money from China
then tax you heavily to provide more government bailouts! John believes
in balanced budgets and, if elected, will work diligently for the passage of
a balanced budget amendment.
John Koster will stand against the immoral practice of piling
unconscionable debt upon future generations. His top priority as your
congressman will be to put people back to work and get the economy
back on track.
John will oppose efforts to put a government bureaucrat between you
and your doctor and supports a repeal and replacement of “ObamaCare”
with free market systems that will drive health care costs downward.
John believes Congress should move forward with a fairer, simpler tax
system which would generate the revenue we need to fund a smaller, less
wasteful federal government.
John Koster believes our nation’s economy can be great once again,
but only if we are willing to take dramatic steps to reign in the regulatory
agencies and unleash the job-creating power of the American free
enterprise system.

Council Boy Scouts of America. Respected Philanthropist
Statement: I am probably the only “Authentic Candidate”; I was born at
the UW Hospital and have lived my entire life inside the 1 st district as
it currently is drawn up. I know well this area, its people and our unique
fl avors and fl are. I was your paperboy; I went to school with you in the
Shoreline School district and earned my Eagle Scout Rank serving in the
community from troop 348. I am also easily the most DC experienced of
the candidates for this offi ce. As an industry leader I have been directly
involved with drafting federal industry reform legislation and working
Congress to move those bills into law. In my over 50 visits to DC I
have worked on numerous distinct projects involving the Congress, the
Department of the Interior, Veterans Affairs and HUD to name a just a few.
As an Entrepreneur I am a fi scal conservative and believe America needs
to slow down borrowing and move back to a balanced budget ASAP.
On social Issues I am far more moderate; for the God I know and have
experienced has room in His house for everyone!

Darcy Burner
(Prefers Democratic Party)
Elected Experience: Democratic nominee
for Congress, received more votes than any
Democratic candidate in district before or
since. Extensive work with Congress.
Other Professional Experience: Executive
Director, Progressive Congress Action Fund.
Principal, Afghanistan Study Group. Author,
A Responsible Plan to End the War in Iraq. Group Program Manager,
Microsoft and other software companies.
Education: Bachelor’s Degree in computer science with a special fi eld of
economics, Harvard University.
Community Service: Former president of Ames Lake Homeowners
Association; coached YMCA youth sports; led Hoppers, the Microsoft
women’s organization. Boards of Center for International Policy,
Progressive Ideas Network, Netroots Foundation, ActBlue, Council for a
Livable World’s PeacePAC; NARAL Pro-Choice America.
Statement: Darcy Burner grew up in Nebraska, third out of fi ve children
in a blue collar military family headed by an Air Force veteran and public
school teacher. Her brother served in Iraq. She understands the rural way
of life, American values and protecting our country, and standing up for
our veterans who keep our country safe.
She has said that it makes no sense to spend more than $100 billion per
year in Afghanistan while we need schools and infrastructure built in our
own country. It’s long past time we had a realistic plan for returning control
of Afghanistan to the Afghan people and bringing our troops and money
home. That money – more than $250 million last year in this district alone
– should be invested in rebuilding our roads, bridges, and schools here
and ensuring that every child in Washington gets a world-class education.
Darcy has fought tooth and nail to protect the Social Security and
Medicare benefi ts people have paid for and earned.
All of the progress we need on the economy, health care, and education
requires fi xing our broken Congress. Darcy proposes putting a halt to
corporations buying elected offi cials by passing campaign fi nance and
lobbying reform; opening up Congress’s business to the public; and
forcing members of Congress to disclose earmarks and last-minute
changes to bills.
Darcy has been endorsed by the Democrats in the 42nd LD, 32nd LD,
10th LD, 44th LD, Snohomish County, and by the Ironworkers, IBEW
Local 46, UA Local 32, NOW, PeacePAC, Peace Action, and Democracy
for America.
Darcy Burner will make a difference for us because she is a proven fi ghter
who stands up to bullies and backs up her words with deeds to get things
done.

Elected Experience: Not an elected position,

the tax system to help small businesses.
Other Professional Experience: Successful
career as businesswoman and entrepreneur.
Former Microsoft executive, led local hightech startups, and served as an advisor to an international non-profi t
helping struggling families.
Education: B.A., Reed College; M.B.A., University of Washington.
Community Service: I’ve mentored students at UW Business School,
been active in my church, serving as a board member. Volunteered with
the PTA, Girl Scouts and YWCA, supporting transitional housing, job
training and services to help families get back on their feet.
Statement: I’m running to fi ll the remainder of Rep. Inslee’s current term
(as well as the two-year term in the new 1st District) because the people
of this region deserve consistent representation in Congress at a time
when a number of important votes may come up.
Making the Right Decisions on Critical Issues. As Congress takes on
tough issues this December, I will stand up for the middle class. I will vote
to reduce the debt, end the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and protect
Social Security and Medicare.
Protecting the middle class. My life experience has taught me we need
to do more to revitalize our economy and protect working families and
seniors. We need policies that encourage innovation and job growth.
Economic prosperity for all is only possible with investments in schools,
student aid, roads and job-creating research. Instead of tax breaks for the
wealthy, I will rebuild the middle class by restoring these investments.
Standing up for our shared values. I support the “Buffett Rule” to make
millionaires pay their fair share. I will work to protect Social Security,
Medicare and a woman’s right to choose. I know what it takes to make
the tax system fairer. I implemented Washington’s successful tax amnesty
program, saving small businesses millions and helping close our state’s
budget defi cit. I will fi ght to eliminate tax breaks for oil companies and
crack down on Wall Street abuses.
A workhorse, not a show horse. I am proud to be endorsed by Gov.
Chris Gregoire, Aerospace Machinists, Teamsters, Snohomish County
Democrats, thousands of teachers and school employees across the state
and many others. They know that in Congress I will be a workhorse, not a
show horse. They know I am committed to making sure every family has
the opportunity to succeed.

Elected Experience: King County Council;
Washington State Attorney General
Other Professional Experience: Perkins

Attorneys General, 2011-12; Norm Maleng Honoree award, Eastside
Domestic Violence Program, 2010; Friend of Children award, Washington
State PTA, 2008.
Statement: Son of a teacher and a soldier, Rob McKenna learned the
value of public service from his parents, and wants to continue serving
Washington’s people as Governor. He will take our state in a New
Direction, promoting excellence in public schools, helping innovative
businesses create jobs and reforming state government.
Rob graduated from Sammamish High and the UW. Marilyn and Rob
are the parents of four children who have attended public school, and
their passion for education led him to serve as president of the Bellevue
Schools Foundation and Bellevue College Foundation. Rob’s education
platform is simple - put students fi rst, fully fund our schools and stop
cutting our colleges and universities.
Rob knows the private sector creates jobs, not government. He traveled
across Washington learning from small business owners about our state’s
burdensome tax system and redundant regulations. His New Direction
plan cuts government red tape, provides small business tax relief and
reduces health care costs by giving employees greater control over their
health spending.
McKenna has been a leader as Washington’s Attorney General, reducing
staff while increasing productivity. He made the offi ce a national model for
protecting consumers from mortgage fraud and identity theft, earning his
peers’ bipartisan “Outstanding Attorney General” award.
McKenna grew up in a military family. Living around the world gave him
a great appreciation for different backgrounds and viewpoints. Rob used
that experience to build bipartisan support for laws fi ghting prescription
drug abuse, domestic violence and to crack down on sex offenders.
Washington faces tough budget challenges that threaten public schools
and higher education, the social safety net and our economic future. Rob
McKenna is an experienced leader who works across party lines to solve
problems. For great public schools, government reform and more private
sector job creation, please vote Rob McKenna for Governor.

representing Yakima Valley; U.S. House of
Representatives 1993-1994 representing
Eastern Washington; U.S. House of
Representatives 1999-2012 representing

Other Professional Experience: Attorney, author of Apollo’s Fire: Igniting
America’s Clean Energy Economy.
Education: Ingraham High School, Seattle, WA; graduated from the
University of Washington with a B.A. in economics in 1972; graduated
Magna Cum Laude from Willamette University Law School in 1976.
Community Service: Charter member of Hoopaholics to raise money for
Childhaven; coached youth sports; served as an honorary board member
of the Washington Wildlife and Recreation Coalition.
Statement: My mission as governor is this - to create a stronger and
growing economy for Washington. We invent, we create, and we build. It
was our innovations that led the revolution in aerospace, then software.
Today we are on the cusp of new revolutions in health sciences and clean
energy technology. This is our moment to grow our economy and create
jobs. We need to seize it.
Having lived, worked, and represented both sides of the Cascades, I
understand how our economy works. Making Washington a hub for clean
energy will launch small businesses across the state, allowing wind and
biofuels from the east to power skyscrapers in the west.
To build this stronger economy and ensure every child has an opportunity
for a successful future, we must adopt a no-excuses approach to
education. I’ll implement proven reforms that produce more innovative
schools and insist on high quality teachers in every classroom. We
will prioritize our investments in: early childhood education; science,
technology, engineering and math (STEM); and make college more
accessible and affordable. No excuses.
I will bring this forward-thinking to our state by implementing lean
management techniques to improve government services and effi ciency
and deliver health care at lower cost. In order to create change we need
a leader who is willing to buck the status quo. I am one of the few who
voted against the bank bailout and the deregulation of Wall Street.
We need a leader who is willing to protect senior citizens’ health care and
pensions. I am the only candidate in this race who will stand up to protect
a woman’s right to choose, which is why I’ve been endorsed by Planned
Parenthood Votes Northwest.
We can build a working Washington. I would be honored to have your
vote.

Shahram Hadian
(Prefers Republican Party)
Elected Experience: Proud to have no
political experience- we need servant leaders,
not career politicians.
Other Professional Experience: Hadian,
founder of the Truth In Love Project, has real
world experience serving his community as a
Christian pastor, police offi cer, teacher, coach,
and small business owner.
Education: B.A., Puget Sound Christian College- Biblical Studies/
Christian Ministry. Graduated 2nd in class, Washington State Law
Enforcement Academy.
Community Service: Committed servant leader in the community: former
neighborhood association president/board member, Young Life leader, led
overseas humanitarian missions trips, YWCA shelter volunteer, and leader
in the fi ght to pass new laws in Snohomish County, toughening lewd
behavior laws and combating prostitution.
Statement: Hadian’s campaign is centered on the need for “courageous
leadership” to tackle the root issues of our moral, economic, and national
security crisis, place principles before party politics, stand up and fi ght
against political correctness, and clean house in our government and
demand Constitutional integrity.
Shahram experienced a transformational life change 13 years ago when
he committed his life to Jesus Christ. He immediately faced persecution
and disapproval from his family. According to Islam, his conversion means
he is an “apostate” and deserves death as a former muslim. In spite of
this opposition, Shahram persevered and has been a Christian pastor for
10 years.
Hadian boldly addresses root issues such as: tackling the power of public
sector unions and working to become a right-to-work state, deregulating
our job creators- small businesses, gutting the Department of Ecology and
its strangling regulations, confronting the $1.5 billion/year impact of illegal
immigration, and becoming energy independent by supporting renewable
hydroelectricity.
Hadian proudly stands for the sanctity of life and marriage (one man,
one woman). He believes we must restore control of education to the
local level, protect parental rights, and say “No” to federal “Race to
the Top” education standards. To protect our state’s 10th Amendment
rights, Hadian will fi ght against unconstitutional UN Agenda 21 and its
devastating effects on property rights, oppose Obamacare and work to
solve healthcare at the state level through common sense competitive
solutions.
“We are One Nation Under God. We say ‘God Bless America’, but it is
time that America blesses God and welcomes Him back into our nation.
I am committed to lead Washington as a statesman, not a politician.
Together, we can bring Courageous Leadership to Washington State!” -

Christian Joubert
(States No Party Preference)
Elected Experience: Yes.
Other Professional Experience: Journalist
in Israel, taught social science, oenology,
law (Europe, Seattle, Gonzaga Law school,
where I established the school’s international
human rights law section). Worked in
organic agriculture, directed a holistic health
retreat center. Litigated constitutional, products liability, medical and legal
malpractice actions.
Education: French rural schools, Assumption Prep., Boston College
(theater, sociology), University Massachusetts (political science), journalism
(Bordeaux), international relations (Jerusalem), political sociology,
mainstream medicine, Chinese medicine, nutrition (Paris), naturopathy, Law
(Europe).
Community Service: Legal and educational contributions to encourage
industrial tobacco, allopathic modern medicine, the legal profession and the
State to reconvert to a holistic approach to business.
Statement: As I showed during the 2008 gubernatorial run, thanks to which
my Action Plan was embraced as the third political force of the State, (http://
www.christianforgovernor2008.com) our Republic is broken. The two party
system can not meet most of our basic needs. Our health, resources, jobs
are too often un-necessarily sacrifi ced on the altar of predatory economics
and shortsighted ideology.
To meet these challenges, I respectfully propose a few policies, many of
which would be implemented via executive orders, given the urgency.
The fi rst priority is hinged on a pro-active holistic health-care system in
association with health freedoms advocacy which will bestow upon each
Washingtonian the best wellbeing conditions . Next focus, a sustainable
economy via affordable housing , clean energy “breakthroughs”, the billion
dollars wellness and hemp (textile, paper, building, fuel, medicine, food)
industries, with the more traditional software, aerospace, agriculture and
maritime trade.
The reduction of the legal work week to 35 hours and retirement at 60 (to
provide jobs for our youth and save on health costs), sustainable living
wages pegged on infl ation, tax breaks for progressive corporations and tax
incentives to dissuade corporations from delocalizing production overseas is
desirable .
Visionary leadership is needed to implement equal access to affordable and
relevant education, art and civil justice, the restructuring of our dysfunctional
legal system and public fi nancing of electoral campaigns.
This “Holistic Governorship” Plan would be fi nanced via taxes against what
destroys health and resources, including on fi nancial speculation. Less
“Government” and more tax relief in the “real” working economy with massive
funds from our innovative industries, including from the Great Statue of
Responsibility and its Holistic Health Civic Center, would contribute to reduce
by half within four years the State’s debts and diseases while simultaneously
ensuring equal access to health, prosperity, education, security and justice.

Statement: Freedom! How much does it cost? With the high price of gas,
food, shelter, heat and electricty. With taxes on the rise where will it all
end. Our way of life is changing for the worse. We cannot take anything
for granted,not even going to the store. Choosing between food and gas
is disheartening. Common sence is a thing of the past along with moral
values. .What is the truth about our goverment and how can we change
it. Lies ,waste and fear is on the daily news. Excessive use of force about
police in this state is what we hear all to often . We are becomeing a
military state under fear from our own goverment. How sad! When will
our goverment completely fail , not if it will fail. We the people are fedup
with goverment not doing right by us. I am part of the 99 percent . I have
worked hard at foundries for 7 years and aerospace for 25 years. I have
learned that when times are hard ,(Work hard) and when times are good
(Work harder). You don,t know whe times will be good again. Buying extra
is a thing of the past. Just having enough is a challenge. Rich are getting
richer and the middle class is the next poor. What about our children will
they own a house? I feel I can change this with your help. Goverment
needs debt counselling and restructuring. Stop wasting your money
on special interests and lavish needs. I am hard working, mechanically

Education: Graduate of Lee Academy, Clarksdale, MS, 1986. Bachelor of

Community Service: Food Bank Volunteer, Science Curriculum
committee, Boys and Girls Club youth volleyball coach, Sultan Youth
Basketball (SYB) coach, Sultan Youth football coach, School and PTA
Volunteer.
Statement: There are two unfortunate, but prevailing, truths in our current
political environment.
First, the two ruling political parties have been in control of us for a very
long time and it appears evident that their fi ght is no longer for us, the
hardworking, tax paying people, but, instead, their fi ght is only to get,
and keep, control and defeat the other political side. Their rule has been
characterized by divisiveness and loyalty to party (partisanship), not the
people.
The second great truth is that the infl uence of money has so corrupted
our political process that our elections now have the appearance of being
purchased by the highest bidder, while the concerns of most hardworking,
tax paying, people go unnoticed.
At The Imagine Liberty Campaign I am running as an independent
candidate, not affi liated with any party, and we are not asking for or
accepting donations because government should represent all people, not
just those individuals and groups who are buying infl uence.
On our website you can fi nd the answers to the questions that motivate
our campaign. The cause of liberty is great because it entrusts people
to make their own decisions about how they choose to live their life and
it diminishes the power by which some try to use government to enforce
their expectations and wants upon others. The cause of liberty is great
because it takes control away from the parties and the powerful and gives
control back to the people.
We will be told again this year, as always, that this year’s election is too
important to “waste our vote.” I suggest, however, that the most powerful
vote you could cast, this year, would be to break the cycle of control and
have The Courage to Think Independent.

Administration, Law
Community Service: Food Bank, community Garden
Statement: My name is Javier O. Lopez, and I believe that all humans are
good by nature. It takes a lot of hard work to turn bad. Here in Washington
we must fi nd good people to govern, we need to fulfi ll our destiny of
justice and equality. I believe the time has come to speak of kindness and
love. Those who speak of despair are practitioners of hate. They should
keep away from our highways, from our homes, from us. We need to
recognize that all humans can be of service, but don’t let them become
rulers of our state because they will make you suffer; they will make your
children and grandchildren debtors of their deeds.
Dear friends, dear Washingtonians keep commonsense, guard it with your
life make sure you use it in this election for it may be the most important
election of your life.
As for me I only regret having one life to give to my country and it has
already been given to the people. The road to the heart is faith and good
works, riches can be stolen, but the riches of the heart will be yours
forever and ever and keep in mind that double standards are the only
tools they have and their deceit is without comfort, faith or value.
If there is righteousness in the heart there will be strength in the character.
If there is beauty there is harmony in the home. There will be order in the
nation and there will be peace in the world, but only if people stop taking
advantage of you.
For example your present governor has given herself a raise while the
nation is facing bankruptcy.
Vote for Javier O. Lopez and I will give my salary back to the taxpayers.

Bill Finkbeiner
(Prefers Republican Party)
Elected Experience: Fourteen years in the
State Legislature, including a term as Senate
Majority Leader.
Other Professional Experience: Business
owner, investing in sustainable real estate.
Worked for fi ve years at Microsoft (contractor
1995 - 2000) and helped start Washington’s
fi rst online high school.
Education: M.B.A. University of Washington, B.A. Whitman College, Lake
Washington High School.
Community Service: Bill and his wife Kristin are active in their
community and their children’s lives. Over the years, along with serving
on boards of 4Culture, Kirkland Boys and Girls Club, and Cascade Land
Conservancy, Bill has also coached his daughter’s soccer team and
helped his son’s lacrosse club build new sports fi elds.
Statement: Bill Finkbeiner knows the gridlock and partisan bickering
in our State’s Capitol is unacceptable. As the Lieutenant Governor, Bill
Finkbeiner will work with both political parties to encourage a more
cooperative, less partisan, and less lobbyist-infl uenced government.
Bill Finkbeiner has the experience to succeed. He served 14 years in
the Legislature, including a term as Senate Majority Leader, before
returning to private business. Now, he’s bringing his business and political
experience forward to push change through the marbled halls of the
Capitol.
Some of the reforms are simple, like getting rid of the aisle that separates
Republicans and Democrats on the fl oor of the Senate. Other changes –
reducing the number of partisan staff and limiting the infl uence of lobbyists
– are more complicated; but all will make Olympia more open to citizens
and less beholden to special interests.
Bill Finkbeiner has won support from both Democrats and Republicans.
His endorsements include: Rob McKenna, Cathy McMorris Rodgers,
Dino Rossi, Slade Gorton, Sam Reed, Washington Conservation Voters,
NARAL, Michael Heavey and Larry Springer. Bill is a lifelong Washington
resident. He and his wife Kristin (co-founder of MomsRising) and their two
children live in Kirkland.

James Robert Deal
(States No Party Preference)
Elected Experience: Precinct committee
person while in law school. No previous
ambition for higher offi ce.
Other Professional Experience: Attorney
since 1978, helping clients modify their
mortgages and doing environmental law on a
pro bono basis as president of www.FluorideClass-Action.com.
Education: Western Washington University, B.A., M.Ed.; Anglican
Theological College at UBC; University of Washington, J.D.
Community Service: A leader in the safe water movement. Health
educator and author of a foodways book on nutrition, health, and the
history of diet.
Statement: Many water districts add an industrial grade of fl uoride to
drinking water – fl uorosilicic acid. It contains lead and arsenic and leaches
large amounts of lead from pipes. The body excretes these chemicals
poorly; they accumulate lifetime. They are most harmful to fetuses and
infants (reducing IQ), diabetics, those with arthritis and thyroid, kidney,
and heart disease. Blacks and Hispanics are impacted more than Whites.
Chemical companies earn a half billion dollar per year selling us this fi lth.
This racket must end.
Other Priorities: We are decapitalizing Washington, letting schools and
infrastructure decline. Only the rich can pay more, and they should. We
need a tax on high incomes and large capital gains. Washington should
increase its minimum wage. Anything which can be grown organically
should be grown organically. GMO crops should be outlawed and GMO
foods labeled. Washington needs a master transportation plan and can do
more to reduce carbon emissions. We need stronger campaign fi nance
laws. Schools should have large, year-round gardens and serve more
vegetables and less sugar and fat.
I run to raise issues others avoid. I will hold preconstitutional conventions
around the state to study needed structural changes.

Mark Greene
(Prefers Democracy Indep. Party)
 Elected Experience: Like some of the most
renowned and respected American political
leaders upon taking offi ce, none, but I was
the Democratic nominee for U.S. Congress
(Alaska District) in 2000 and 2002. I am the
founder of the political organization the Party
of Commons (since 2006).
Other Professional Experience: Legal Assistant experience, including
free-lance businesses such as legal research in Minnesota during 1990’s.
USMC veteran; 1970’s.
Education: Inver Hills College, Inver Grove Heights, MN, A.A.S. Degree
received in 1990’s.
Community Service: Founder of Democracy in Election Process, an
organization that helps citizens with voter registration, civic affairs, and
legal forms (since 2004, originally Commoner Committee for Political
Affairs).
Statement: I’m endorsing Darcy Burner for Congress (1 st CD), because
she will protect Social Security and other basic anti-poverty programs,
be at least moderately anti-interventionist in her foreign policy outlook,
uphold the Constitution, and show independence, i.e., not letting party
bosses dictate to her.
The Common Man’s Candidate for Lieutenant Governor: I had to get
on the ballot by petition, because I don’t get funds from parties, special
interest groups, or from Establishment-types. After all, they realize that
I am very sincere in representing the common person’s interests, not
theirs.’ I’m a real democrat, though independent, not a fake.
The environment is of fundamental importance as everything from the
economy to morality relates to it. We shouldn’t fool with Mother Nature
recklessly, if at all, but since the government has done so, we have to
rectify the wrongs through everything from mandating labeling of GMO
food to phasing out nuclear energy.
Our state and national constitutions together are the fi rewall between
democracy and totalitarianism, as democracy, after all, is the respect
of differences of opinion that we have with one another, and shown by
certain essential functions such as voting. It’s a politician’s solemn duty to
uphold our constitutions.

Statement: In 1983, I left my hometown of Puyallup with $200 and

Journal editor at Quincy Valley Historical Society. Various volunteer
service positions through church.
Statement: Washington is a state of many voices. From the various tribes
of the First Nations, to the pioneers, to the immigrants from nearly every
country on planet Earth, Washington is culturally, ethically, and politically
diverse. Yet this diversity is not fully refl ected in our election system, nor
is our system as secure as it could be. My proposals are to eliminate the
primary, to eliminate any defi nition of major or minor party by the state, to
have ballot access rule applicable to all parties and independents equally,
to have each candidate representing a party be the endorsed candidate of
that party, to institute Voter ID, to end Mail-in Voting and return to precinct
voting and paper ballots with absentee ballots and provisional ballots
available, and to prevent the implementation of E-voting. These steps will
put Washington in the forefront of safe, secure, equal and open elections
where Washingtonians of all political persuasions will be assured that their
vote carry the same weight as all other votes and is handled in a manner
that protects their vote from hacking, loss or damage, and fraud.

Elected Experience: This is a job for
a professional, not a politician. I work
professionally to make organizations faster,
more effi cient, and more effective.
Other Professional Experience: In the 23
years since earning my MBA, I’ve done 150+
performance audits. I’ve been a successful
executive and principle consultant in large professional services fi rms and
run business units for Fortune 50 fi rms. I’ve worked with major federal
agencies; non-profi ts; and innovative private sector businesses, large and
small.
Education: BBA, MBA, George Washington University.
Community Service: Elected to leadership in Church, youth
organizations, etc. Citizen activist focusing on good/open government
issues. Active charity fundraiser. Married 27 years; two children.
Statement: State auditor is a job for an independent professional, not a
politician. That’s why retiring state auditor Brian Sonntag says “...[Watkins]
is particularly well qualifi ed based on his experience and background to
advance the State Auditor’s Offi ce and be an independent advocate for
taxpayers.”
I have the judgment and real world experience to make sure we get a
dollar’s value from every dollar we pay in taxes. Since earning my MBA,
I’ve worked successfully for 23 years to make organizations faster, more
effective, and more effi cient – and we need more of that in Olympia.
My opponent is a professional politician who voted repeatedly to weaken
the auditor’s offi ce, massively increase state spending, and hike taxes.
Now, he’s asking you to trust him to audit and evaluate the very same
government programs he voted to create! That’s like asking a fox to watch
the henhouse.
We need government we can trust. Citizens won’t allow the legislature
to raise taxes: effi ciency and cost savings are the only way to fund our
shared priorities while rebuilding voter trust. As your state auditor, I pledge
to drive effi ciency and effectiveness; to limit fraud, waste, and abuse; and
defend and expand open, transparent government.

the independent voice we need to ensure state dollars are focused on the
right priorities. He’s unwavering in his work eliminating waste and holding
government accountable, ensuring we have transparent government. We
need his kind of leadership.”
Troy believes in fi scal integrity. Leading by example, he was the fi rst of
147 legislators to voluntarily cut his pay in the economic downturn. Troy is
the only candidate in this race to cut his pay and refuse all special session
reimbursement payments.
Troy believes our ability to focus on top priorities like education depends

uphold the will of the people ensuring lower class sizes, and uphold voterapproved initiatives fi ghting unfair tax increases. The News Tribune says,
“The state needs more of his fi scal prudence. Kelley brings a welcome

Peter Goldmark has restored integrity to the management of nearly 15
million acres of forest, agricultural land and water resources. Peter works

Other Professional Experience: No

Education: I grew up in Tacoma, Washington
on an ‘in city farm’. Had many animals and
allot of responsibility. Have always learned
from watching nature, and have connected to it’s soul my entire life. I
didn’t know at the time how much this love would grow. I attended the
University of Washington and graduated with a degree in business
administration. I had a “born again” experience a few years ago while
hiking in Zion National Park, Utah. And now I know my love and
connection to nature are my purpose. I believe nature is sacred. I am a
guardian of it.
Community Service: No information submitted
Statement: Zeitgeist Washingtonians! The following are destroying
our natural resources: The federal government and it’s many agencies,
multi-national corporations, lobbyists, and the politicians who are
overly infl uenced by them. I am the no-party candidate, and lifelong
Washingtonian, I am a lover of nature and my fellow man. I am not money,
or power motivated.
I believe climate change is real. The incumbent admitted our forests are
dying, but isn’t moving fast enough to reverse the trend. He has had 4
years, and not enough to show for it.
I will make clear-cutting of forests illegal on state and private land. I will
propose to legislature a “Tree Tax”. This tree tax will be used to fund our
school trust. Eventually, I will eliminate our fi nancial dependency to cut
timber on our public lands. This will help salmon runs, and also help Puget
Sound . A forest takes several hundred years to mature. We will run out of
trees before we run out of money.
We must protect our greatest asset, our natural resources. Ask yourself,
“is the status-quo working? Then visit zeitgeistmovie.com. There is a
solution. I will make it happen for us. I’m asking for your help.

(Prefers Republican Party)
Elected Experience: No information
submitted
Other Professional Experience: Farmer/
rancher, owner of Back Forty Farms, our
second-generation family farm; NFL player
1981 – 1989; Presidential appointee to
Washington State Committee of national Farm
Service Agency 2000-2008.
Education: Graduated from Connell High School; B.S in Political Science,
Portland State University.
Community Service: Connell High School Football Coach 1999-2009,
coaching teams that included my three sons (I also have one daughter
with my wife of 30 years, Kristi, and 2 grandchildren), and winning 2 state
championships; Charity Tournament Director, “Fighting Children’s Cancer”
2004-2010; Member, Washington State Farm Bureau.
Statement: In Washington, we depend on the land for food, homes,
business and recreation. But “We the People” also own millions of acres
held in trust for us. Revenues from those lands (now, more than $200
million) fi nance school construction and many county services. But the
state projections show that those revenues are likely to go down in
coming years.
But we can turn that around to protect our children’s’ future by generating
more revenues through sustainable uses of these properties.
I am a steward of the land-a second generation farmer in the
“breadbasket” known as the Columbia Basin, and an avid sportsman.
In order to be sustainable, I must farm the land to be as productive as
possible but at the same time regard all environmental concerns including
land/water quality, and preservation of wildlife.
Much of the public lands are located in areas that have had little “say” in
Olympia. My goal is to change that process. And I will run Department of
Natural Resources as a lean organization, watching over taxpayer dollars.
I’m a farmer who knows the land, the forests, the water and the wildlife. I’d
like to manage them for the citizens of Washington.

Statement: For the past three years I’ve had the privilege of being your
Superintendent of Public Instruction. I fi rst ran for this offi ce in 2008 to
reform education and bring new leadership to Olympia, and in a few
short years, we’ve made a lot of progress: We replaced the WASL with
a better, fairer system of testing, Enacted reforms to hold everyone in
education more accountable for student learning, and improved our ability
to improve or remove struggling teachers, Created cutting-edge programs
to prepare our kids for the jobs of the future by partnering with companies
like Microsoft and Boeing, And I have consistently led the fi ght in Olympia
for more education funding to meet our constitutional obligation to
Washington’s kids.
I am running for re-election because the work is not done. We must
continue to reform our schools in order to maintain high standards and
increase accountability. And we need to demand full funding of education
so our students have the tools and resources they need to get the worldclass education they deserve.
As a teacher, principal, and legislator I’ve always made our kids’ future the
highest priority.

our schools, we can work together to overcome obstacles. High-stakes
testing and charter schools will not help our students achieve. We need
a variety of assessment methods throughout the year to determine
what students are learning and struggling with. Our schools need to be
safe places, free from bullying with high quality STEM programs, visual/
performing arts, athletics, and vocational education, so students develop
a variety of skills to prepare them to be successful adults. Education is
the most important thing that we do as a civilization. Every dollar spent
educating our citizens decreases unemployment and use of other social
services and increases our quality of life and ability of our people to be

Statement: Every family should have the opportunity to take responsibility
for individualizing the public education of their own children. To that end, I
propose a new foundation for public education, of which the existing local
public school districts would be an unchanged part. This new foundation
would consist of:
Individual Student Trust Accounts - for all students, funded annually using
each student’s existing $10,000+ state education voucher. With approval,
each student’s parents may spend these accumulating funds at any
Registered Public Education Program(s) of their choice. A Registered
Public Education Program would be any educational program, regardless
of ownership, which: accepts only trust funds as tuition, i.e. “free”; fi lls
at least 80% of its openings without admission qualifi cation, i.e. “open
enrollment”; permits no organized devotional instruction or activities; and
publishes measurable educational and behavioral goals for its students.
Students not achieving these goals may be dismissed.
Neighborhood Education Districts - three locally elected trustees will
oversee the educational progress of 50 to 200 participating neighborhood
students. The trustees must approve parental education choices for
students passing applicable WASL tests.
Community Facility Districts - locally elected, will own, operate and
maintain all public facilities. Life-cycle maintenance funds will be included
in the original bond funding.

be outstanding by parents of students 2. Full state funding of education,
accompanied by a ban on special school levies for operations, and
elimination of state business taxes. 3. Establishment of a three-level high
school diploma system: minimum, basic, and advanced. 4. Revision of
our state testing system, in order to eliminate some important fl aws that it
has. 5. Promotion of the methods of teaching that will improve students’

sovereignty is being undermined; Sexual anarchy is being promoted
by some of our most trusted institutions; Our children are not learning
their rights and responsibilities as citizens of a constitutional republic;
The federal government is usurping more and more power from local
government; The morale and combat effectiveness of our military is
being undermined by continual involvement in no-win wars; Religious
liberty is being suppressed at the same time Islamic mosques that
promote terrorism are not being monitored or controlled; Our media are
at best derelict in not keeping us informed on important issues, instead
keeping us occupied with the trivial and mundane; Judges have usurped
legislative authority and in some instances suppressed our Constitutional
liberty, thus changing our republic into an oligarchy; The EPA is imposing
regulations to abolish rural private property ownership and undermine our
economy.
These and other issues require our response. As PCO, I will apply the

Statement: Ex-Congressman Kriedler has been our State’s Insurance
Commissioner for 11 years. It’s time for a change. Over the past seven
years annual healthcare premiums increased 50% and employee share
of premiums increased by 63%. If premium trends continue the average
premium for family healthcare coverage will rise 72 percent by 2020.
Our State Insurance Commissioner’s system for regulating private
insurance companies is outdated. It stifl es and limits competition. Access
of affordable insurance can be expanded through smarter regulations.
Unfair underwriting practices must be stopped to elminate discrimination.
I will present a series of remedies to shortcomings of so-called “healthcare
reform” to restore choice and increase market availability. I will provide
leadership for enabling group purchasing of prescription drugs in this state
to lower healthcare coverage costs and reduce Co-pays. State tort laws
must be reformed to address rising costs to medical care providers in
order to make treatment affordable.
With my four decades of experience as an independent insurance
broker serving Seattle’s commercial insurance needs, I know how to get
insurance cost down for consumers. As a former elected member of the
Lake Washington’s School Board, I worked for better schools by cutting
bureaucracy that discouraged good classroom teaching.

Education: University of Washington, BA,
History
Community Service: Life long resident of the state. I volunteer on behalf
of a variety of community activities and events
Statement: It’s time for a new Insurance Commissioner. Over the last
16 years politicians have run this offi ce and we now have fewer choices
and costs have skyrocketed. I will cut red tape, bureaucracy and reduce
the mandates insurance providers face which keep competing insurance
products out of Washington that are available in neighboring states.
I will reform the Insurance Commissioner’s offi ce as well. Staff has
increased by 35%, to 225, with a budget of $115 million per year. The
result: insurance providers are forced to spend your premium dollars
complying with burdensome and unnecessary paperwork rather than
paying claims.
I have 35 years experience in the insurance industry at every level. I
have trained tens of thousands of your neighbors to be ethical, honest
consumer advocates. I will commit to a performance audit of the offi ce
and to bring small business effi ciency and effectiveness to the job; I will
always put consumers fi rst.
We spend 20% of our income on Insurance; let’s get the politicians out
of the industry. Vote for Scott Reilly for Washington State Insurance
Commissioner

Community Service: Community volunteer.
Statement: The Washington Supreme Court is often a citizen’s Court of
last resort and has the fi nal say on issues of Washington law. The U.S.
Constitution and Washington State’s Constitution are the ultimate laws
upon which decisions must be made. The Constitution should not be a
living, breathing document that changes with the whims of the Court in
response to politics or popular demand. The Constitution is the bedrock
when deciding cases. Judges should be elected without infl uence from a
political party or special interest group. Voters should not settle for a judge
who has been appointed by the most partisan offi ce of the State. Nor
should a judicial candidate be allowed to purchase an election through
contributions from special interest groups and/or attorneys whose cases
could be the subject of that Judge’s rulings. As a Supreme Court justice,
I will insure fundamental constitutional principals are not offended or
altered for the sake of accommodating prevailing popular sentiment. I
am not afraid to challenge prior case law that misapplies fundamental
constitutional principals and rights. My tenure in the Supreme Court will
be one free of special interest associations or the politics that can call into
question Judge’s impartiality.

best qualifi ed candidate for this position. Lawyers nationwide seek her
expertise and advice.

Richard B. Sanders
Legal/Judicial Experience: I served on the
Supreme Court until 2011, fi rst elected in
1995; and reelected in 1998 and 2004. I wrote
more opinions than any other current Justice.
Before that, I practiced law for 26 years. I
also served as an adjunct professor teaching
appellate advocacy at the UW School of Law,
and guest lectured on state constitutional law
at Seattle University.
Other Professional Experience: I am an Eagle Scout and played for the
University of Washington in the Rose Bowl. (French horn!)
Education: B.S. and J.D., University of Washington
Community Service: I frequently lectured and wrote many legal articles
and opinion pieces explaining our constitutional rights.
Statement: Why has Justice Tom Chambers endorsed Richard Sanders
to take his seat on the Court? Because he knows Richard is a person of
unquestioned integrity, devoted to protecting the rights of all citizens.
Article 1, Section 1 of our constitution states: “governments...are
established to protect and maintain individual rights.” I believe that’s also
the job description of a Supreme Court Justice: we must look out for the
“little guy” and protect citizen rights. Sometimes this makes me seem
conservative, as when I support property rights, and sometimes it makes
me seem liberal, as when I fi ght for free speech and personal rights to
privacy. But I am consistent: we have rights the government must not
violate.
Thomas Jefferson said the God who gave us life gave us liberty as
well. It’s a good thought to remember. I have support that cuts across
the spectrum, with endorsements including: the State Republican and
Libertarian Parties; legislators; judges and civil libertarians-- and more
than 1,000 endorsers, including the Association of Washington Business
and Washington Realtors.
Richard Sanders has earned our support and protected our rights. Vote to
return Sanders to the Supreme Court.

Statement: Thank you for the privilege of serving on the Court of Appeals
for the past 14 years.
Your right of appeal to a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals is a
critical part of the safety net that protects our rights. The large volume of
cases and tremendous variety of civil and criminal issues makes the job
very challenging. My experience while a lawyer in private practice and
during 16 years in the legislature prepared me well for the breadth of
issues. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with the other members of the
court and wrestling with those challenges to make just decisions and to
write good opinions.
I believe a judge should serve the community in ways beyond the
decisions made on the bench. I work hard on court budget matters
and participate actively in judicial administration. I remain committed to
making information about the law more accessible to the public through
the “lawforwa.org” website. And, I will continue to promote awareness of
your civic rights and responsibilities through the Council on Public Legal
Education.
I ask for your vote of confi dence and the opportunity to serve you for
another term.

Being an effective judge requires more than just practicing law. Being out

I never will. Those coming to court seeking justice are neighbors, friends

In hard economic times, the court must provide effi cient service with
fewer resources. Technology and private/public partnerships can stretch
the budget and improve results. I have solutions to make court less

vote and put me to work for you.

dozens of pro bono cases to help those who could not afford costly

Serving the public as a judge pro tem, I immediately felt comfortable on

respectfully explain my application of the law to their issue, and do so
effi ciently and patiently. Both lawyers and litigants leave my courtroom

Judge Position No. 46
80 City of Seattle King County Elections is not responsible for the validity
or accuracy of the statements, arguments or rebuttals.
The complete text of this measure is available beginning on page XX.
Seattle Proposition 1 approves a property tax increase totaling
$122,630,099 over seven years. The levy is limited so that
the City shall not levy more than $17,000,000 in the fi rst year
and the levy amount cannot grow by more than 1% per year.
The taxes raised would provide funding for operations, major
maintenance and capital improvements for the Seattle Public
Library. Section 5 of the levy ordinance states that “Levy
investments will be made in the following four categories of
Library Services”:
1. Hours and Access. For example, major program
elements may include supporting operating hours at the
neighborhood branches and Central Library, and providing
support for in-person reference services.
2. Collections. For example, major program elements
may include providing variety and depth in the Library’s
collections with new titles in print and other formats,
increasing the size and quality of the digital collection,
and making local history resources more widely available
through digitization.
3. Technology. For example, major program elements may
include replacements and upgrades to the Library’s public
computer inventory and online resources, including userfocused improvements to the catalog and public website.
4. Maintenance. For example, major program elements
may include enhanced resources to provide regular care
and major maintenance, such as repair or replacement of
structural elements and building systems, for the Library’s
heavily-used buildings as they age, to prolong their useful
life and ensure they are clean, safe and welcoming.
These major program elements are illustrative examples. The
levy funds will be spent in accordance with the annual City
budget process for each year of the levy. The City Librarian and
Library Board shall submit to the Mayor and City Council the
funding and expenditure plan that will support, maintain and
improve the core library services identifi ed in the categories
above. Each year the Library Board shall adopt an annual
operations plan and capital budget.
Proposition 1 would authorize the collection of more property
taxes than would otherwise be allowed by the limits imposed
under the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) Chapter 84.55.
That state law generally limits the annual increase in property
tax revenue to 1% over the highest amount that the City could
have received in one of the three most recent years. Proposition
1 lifts that lid on property taxes.
The taxes authorized by Proposition 1 are in addition to
those collected under the limits of RCW 84.55 or any other
authorized levy lid lifts. In the fi rst year of collection (2013), the
additional tax rate associated with the tax increase authorized
by Proposition 1 for any property owner would be approximately
15 cents per thousand dollars of assessed value. The City’s
total regular property-tax rate would not exceed the state-law
rate limit of $3.60 per $1,000 of assessed value. Taxes levied
in 2019 for collection in 2020, and later tax levies, would be
calculated as if Proposition 1 had not been passed.
Explanatory statement
Proposition No. 1
Regular Tax Levy Including Seattle Public
Libraries
The City of Seattle’s Proposition 1 concerns supporting,
maintaining and improving core Library Services.
This proposition would increase library collections, support
library hours and services, update technology and maintain
library facilities, as provided in Ordinance No. 123851. It
authorizes regular property taxes above RCW 84.55 limits,
allowing additional 2013 collection of up to $17,000,000
(approximately $0.15/$1,000 assessed value) and up to
$122,630,099 over seven years. In 2013, total City taxes
collected would not exceed $3.60 per $1,000 of assessed
value.
Should this levy be approved?
Yes
No
City of Seattle
The West Piazza Library (15,000 Feet) and existing library (22,500 Feet)
total 37,000 feet for little more than the costly, complex remodel of the old
building, likely subject to cost overruns. Costs to repurpose for a non-library
use are signifi cantly less. This is nearly TWICE as much area and avoids a
minimum two year closure. The library professionals of KCLS have designed
an exceptional Piazza library. Vote for the right location: West of Piazza
Park.
Statement submitted by: Laurie Beden, King Parker, and John Galluzzo
lauriebeden@gmail.com
Rebuttal of “Over the Cedar River”
Renton’s new library location next to the Piazza provides Renton great
opportunities for several reasons. A new light-fi lled state of the art library with
great visibility, onsite parking, centrally located in the downtown business
district immediately extends the downtown hub adjacent to the Piazza and
the Pavilion. This new library will provide expanded services to our citizens
while lowering building and operating costs. This also allows the existing
library building over the river to be re-purposed as an environmental center,
giving Renton two fantastic assets for just slightly more than the cost of one
extensive remodel to the existing library. Being centrally located the new
library would open onto the Farmers Market, downtown festivals, car shows,
Renton Art Walk and other great community events. Patrons can easily walk
to and take advantage of Renton’s nearby downtown businesses. The library
also becomes a key component to redevelopment of the downtown.
The clear choice for the new library providing the highest level of service
with minimal investment is the new library location west of the Piazza Park.
Please vote for the Piazza Park Library that will serve our community and
future generations for the next 50 years.
In favor of “West of the Piazza”
In 2010, Renton citizens voted to annex to the King County
Library System (KCLS). The annexation required Renton to
fund and construct two new state of the art libraries to replace
Renton’s two existing libraries. Initially, the city proposed to
locate the new downtown library at the site of the old Big 5 store
west of the downtown Piazza and purchased that land. Since
then, the Renton City Council decided to conduct a popular vote
regarding the location of the new library in downtown. Voters are
being asked to choose the location for the new downtown library
construction. There are two locations under consideration: The
existing library over the Cedar River (100 Mill Ave. S.), and the
site west of the Piazza (508 S. 3rd St.). The city has projected it
will cost $10,100,000 to substantially renovate the existing Cedar
River library to state of the art library standards. There may be
an additional $400,000 cost for temporary relocation of the library
during that construction. The combined amount exceeds the current
budget for the downtown library development. The proposed new
downtown location west of the Piazza is projected to cost, including
land acquisition, $9,300,000. This is the amount budgeted. If voters
choose the site west of the Piazza, the existing library building will
be repurposed for future alternative public use. If the Cedar River
location is chosen, the site west of the Piazza would be repurposed
or sold. Repurposing of either location will require additional
undetermined funding. The complete text of this measure is available beginning on page 82.

The cuts suffered by our libraries are real-- and only getting worse.
From staffi ng levels to collections; routine and long term maintenance;
technology upgrades and branch library hours -- we can’t afford to fall behind
anymore than we already have.
Libraries are an essential service, but as the City budget shrinks, every
department has sacrifi ced-- our libraries are not exempt from revenue loss.
The impacts of these cuts are felt in every neighborhood, by kids, seniors,
and families. With a Yes vote, all 26 branches and downtown will benefi t:
longer hours, more materials, needed safety and maintenance upgrades.
All of us should have access to our Seattle Public Libraries, an essential part
of our quality of life. Please Vote Yes!

No to this tax increase. Yes to higher priority from regular funds.
To force another tax increase, the Mayor and City Council are cutting Library
funding. We must reject the scare tactics and insist that the Library get more in
the regular budget. The City collects almost $1 billion/year in regular revenue.
It can afford to fully fund the Library, one of its smallest departments.
The Library needs full, regular funding, not this levy which moves it away from
fi nancial stability. The levy ordinance is temporary and lacks accountability.
It doesn’t require increased hours, or even exclude reduced hours or closed
branches. It frees the Mayor and Council to divert the Library’s regular funds to
other uses.
Stop the game-playing. Let’s get started on a real solution to this
manufactured crisis. Our Library is too important not to fund it fully from the
regular budget.

Stop City offi cials from playing games with our libraries, which need
regular funding, not this temporary, unaccountable levy
A core public service that we all treasure, Seattle’s libraries are being
starved by the Mayor and City Council. Revenues are increasing, but they
manufactured a crisis to scare voters into approving this $122.6 million ($17
million+/year) property tax increase.
Ballot measures should be used for infrequent capital projects or for
unavoidable emergencies, not for ongoing operations. Operations should
be funded from the regular budget, our City’s statement of its true priorities.
This levy is temporary and moves our Library away from the stable funding it
had for a century.
And it’s the least accountable levy proposed to voters in years. The levy
ordinance (it’s in this pamphlet) governs. Offi cials refused to include any
commitment to maintain libraries’ regular funding (now $51 million/year);
increase hours, services, and technology (didn’t even promise not to cut
them); or empower an oversight committee to protect branch funding from
diversion to the downtown library.
When the libraries needed reconstruction, voters rejected a similarly lax
measure, forcing the Mayor and City Council to craft “Libraries for All” with
accountability which this levy sorely lacks, and voters passed it in 1998. But
the lesson was forgotten.
Only if we say “no” to this levy will offi cials produce a package that
empowers the Library, not themselves. Passage encourages their cutting of
its regular funds, to be diverted to purposes they’re afraid to put before the
voters, like bailing out the mismanaged City pension fund’s $1 billion defi cit.
People are struggling in a tough economy, and property taxes are already
high, with more billions coming to the ballot for the Youth Justice Center;
Medic One; Seawall; Schools; and renewal of the parks, transportation, and
housing levies. Can you afford it?
To save the Library, join us in insisting on real fi nancial security, not holding
it hostage for a tax increase. Stop the Mayor and City Council from playing
games with this cherished institution, and from cutting its regular funding.
Reject this temporary levy, and let’s work together to ensure full Library
funding in the regular budget.

Statement in opposition
YES for SEATTLE LIBRARIES!
Seattle’s neighborhood and downtown libraries are a treasured resource for
all of us. We must keep them, open, accessible and maintain our world class
collection of materials—from archives to e-books, children’s collections to
computers.
The recession, compounded by caps on revenue following Eyman tax cut
initiatives, have resulted in real cuts to library hours and services. With
more cuts on the horizon, we have the opportunity to step up and make an
investment in our libraries with a YES vote on Seattle Proposition 1.
LET’S KEEP LIBRARIES OPEN AND ACCESSIBLE— TO ALL
All of us should have access to what the Library can offer. The Seattle Public
Library system is the one public institution that is open to all people regardless
of age, economic status, or social class. We can’t allow branches to close
or hours to be cut. Staffi ng levels, maintenance, collections or technology
upgrades should not fall behind more than they already have.
Without this Levy, the ability of our libraries to serve every neighborhood is in
jeopardy. Another year of budget cuts could mean cuts equal to closing fi ve
branch libraries—at a time when more and more people are using our libraries.
Our libraries are an increasingly important destination for kids. With statewide
education cuts and tighter funding at Seattle Schools, our libraries are needed
as a safe, nurturing place to study, do school related research, or receive extra
tutoring after school. Without this levy, cuts in hours and technology threaten
access and services Seattle kids deserve.
NEIGHBORHOOD INVESTMENTS WORTH PROTECTING
We must maintain the whole system. In 1998, voters overwhelmingly passed a
measure that funded construction of the new Downtown Main Library, four new
branches, and renovated all existing Library branches. These levy funds will
protect and maintain one of the fi nest library systems in the country.
With your vote, these funds will be put to immediate, positive use. The current
policy of shutting down the entire system for one week each summer will end;
hours would be added to branch libraries; and, all 26 branches and the main
Library downtown will be open on Sundays.
Neighborhood libraries are a critical part of our quality of life, providing study
space, meeting facilities, materials for personal and professional growth, and
educational programs that build great communities.
Please join leaders and organizations throughout Seattle in support of our
Libraries!

82 City of Seattle
Full text of Ordinance No. 123851
AN ORDINANCE relating to regular property taxes; requesting that a special
election be held concurrent with the August 7, 2012, general election for
submission to the qualifi ed electors of the City a proposition to lift the limit on
regular property taxes under Chapter 84.55 RCW and authorize the City to levy
additional taxes for up to seven years for the purpose of supporting, maintaining
and improving core public library services; authorizing creation of a new
subfund; ratifying and confi rming certain prior acts; and providing for effective
dates.
WHEREAS, The Seattle Public Library (Library) was established in 1890 and
since that time has served as a free source of information and a community
gathering place for residents of Seattle and the region; and
WHEREAS, in 1998 Seattle voters overwhelmingly supported the Libraries for
All bond measure, which made Library services more accessible throughout
the City by supporting the construction of four branch libraries in communities
without library service, the replacement or renovation of 22 existing branches
and the development of a new downtown Central Library; and
WHEREAS, the successful implementation of Libraries for All has contributed to
a tremendous growth in Library usage; in 2011 the Library recorded 6,700,000
in-person patron visits system-wide, circulated over 11,000,000 items and
hosted 1,500,000 public internet sessions; and
WHEREAS, the Library provides residents with access to an array of free
services and programming, including computer and job search classes, tax
preparation help and citizenship classes and introduces Seattle to local and
world-renowned authors through author readings and book discussion groups;
and
WHEREAS, the Library is an important partner in the education of Seattle’s
youth through crucial literacy activities for young children, homework help,
programs to encourage reading over summer vacation, teen activities,
partnerships with teachers and schools, and other vital services; and
WHEREAS, the Library’s public computers and wireless network provide
free computer and internet access for Seattle residents, and Library staff are
available to help residents to fi nd, evaluate and use information; and
WHEREAS, the Library’s mobile services bring books and other materials
to seniors and other residents who may lack the mobility to access their
neighborhood branch library; and
WHEREAS, the Library has no dedicated funding source to keep operating
budgets stable or keep pace with increasing maintenance costs; and
WHEREAS, about 95 percent of the Library’s 2012 operating budget is
supported by the City’s General Fund; and
WHEREAS, the Library’s 2012 capital budget is primarily supported by the City’s
General Fund and Real Estate Excise Tax (REET) revenues; and
WHEREAS, the City applies a 0.5 percent REET to all real estate sales
transactions in Seattle, and because the amount of revenue that the City
receives from REET is determined by both the volume and value of these
transactions, the Library’s capital budget is similarly subject to this volatility; and
WHEREAS, the weakening of the national and local economies in recent years
has affected City revenues and placed signifi cant spending pressures on the
General Fund and REET; and
WHEREAS, the Library’s heavy reliance on the General Fund and REET makes
it particularly vulnerable to the constraints on the growth of these revenue
sources; and
WHEREAS, the Library’s reliance on the City’s General Fund and REET places
it in competition for funding with other city priorities, and
WHEREAS, as a result of constraints on the City’s General Fund, the entire
Library system has been closed for one week every year since 2009, Library
employees have taken an unpaid furlough of one week every year since 2009,
fi fteen of the 26 neighborhood branch libraries are currently closed two days per
week and the Library’s collections budget has been cut by more than 13 percent
since 2009; and
WHEREAS, the Library’s capital budget has been cut by 50 percent since 2009
as a result of constraints on the City’s General Fund and REET revenues; and
WHEREAS, the City’s fi nancial situation is not expected to signifi cantly improve
within the next three to four years and further reductions in General Fund
support for the Library appear to be unavoidable; and
WHEREAS, the Library has already restructured to gain effi ciencies, so further
reductions related to the anticipated 2013 General Fund shortfall would have a
signifi cant impact on Library services; and
WHEREAS, the City Council may not increase regular property taxes by more
than one percent per year without a vote of the people; and
WHEREAS, levy proceeds support library system operations in other
jurisdictions, including Port Townsend, Washington, and Multnomah County
(Portland), Oregon; and
WHEREAS, in response to a 2010 Statement of Legislative Intent (2010 SLI 95-
1-A-1), the Library, City Council and Mayor reviewed and considered alternative
funding sources that could be used to support the Library’s operations; and
WHEREAS, the Library, City Council and Mayor identifi ed a property tax levy lid
lift as the revenue source that could most feasibly be used in combination with
the City’s General Fund and REET support; and
WHEREAS, during 2010-11 the Library developed a Strategic Plan based on
an extensive public engagement process, using a series of open houses, public
forums, an advisory committee and a community survey that generated nearly
33,000 responses; and
WHEREAS, in early 2012 the Library held three public forums and conducted an
online survey in order to help identify and prioritize the Library services that levy
proceeds could be used to support, maintain and improve; and
WHEREAS, the Library worked with the City Council and Mayor to consider the
levels of funding that would be required to support, maintain and improve core
Library services; and
WHEREAS, it is the intent of the City Council and Mayor to continue to provide
General Fund and REET support to the Library at 2012 service levels, adjusted
proportionately based on increases or decreases to such support for comparable
City departments; and
WHEREAS, the City Charter authorizes the Library Board to oversee the
Library’s annual operating and capital budgets; and
WHEREAS, the Library Board recognizes the need for additional revenue to
support, maintain and improve core Library services, understands the current
constraints on the City’s General Fund and REET revenues and, therefore,
supports a property tax levy lid lift that would provide the Library with a new
revenue source that could be used in combination with General Fund and REET;
NOW, THEREFORE,
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1. Findings. The City Council makes the following fi ndings and
declarations:
A. A strong Library system supports the economic, educational and cultural
vitality of the City and helps to foster an informed community;
B. Libraries are anchor institutions in Seattle neighborhoods; and
C. A new dedicated and stable source of funding would diversify the Library’s
existing funding base. A stable source of funding, in combination with the City’s
General Fund and REET revenue, is needed if the Library is to continue to
provide the operating hours, collections, services, technology and programs
valued by Seattle residents, and preserve the recent capital investments in
Library buildings that were supported by Libraries for All.
Section 2. Defi nitions. The following terms, when used and capitalized in this
ordinance, shall have defi nitions stated below:
City of Seattle 83
Full text of Ordinance No. 123851
 A. “City” means the City of Seattle.
 B. “Library Services” means the programs, services, capital improvements
and administration referred to in Section 5, with such modifi cations as the City
Council may from time to time authorize by ordinance.
 C. “Library Board” means the board of trustees of the Library, a fi vemember body appointed by the Mayor and confi rmed by the City Council, with
exclusive control of the fi nances of the Library under RCW Chapter 27.12.210
and sole authority to expend the Library Fund under Article XII of the Seattle City
Charter, consistent with the annual appropriation of funds by the City Council.
 D. “Proceeds” means that portion of regular property taxes levied and
collected as authorized by voter approval pursuant to this ordinance that are
above the limits on levies provided for in RCW 84.55.010, and all interest and
other earnings derived from that portion of the levy.
 Section 3. Levy of Regular Property Taxes – Submittal. The City hereby
submits to the qualifi ed electors of the City a proposition as authorized by RCW
84.55.050 to exceed the levy limitation on regular property taxes contained
in Chapter 84.55 RCW, as it now exists or may hereafter be amended, for
property taxes levied in 2012 through 2018 for collection in 2013 through 2019,
respectively, raising up to $122,630,099 in aggregate over a period of up to
seven years. The proposition shall be limited so that the City shall not levy more

Library, for Library Services. Levy investments will be made in the following four
categories of Library Services:
 A. Hours and Access. Major program elements include supporting
operating hours at the neighborhood branches and Central Library, and providing
support for in-person reference services.
 B. Collections. Major program elements include providing variety and
depth in the Library’s collections with new titles in print and other formats,
increasing the size and quality of the digital collection, and making local history
resources more widely available through digitization.
 C. Technology. Major program elements include replacements and
upgrades to the Library’s public computer inventory and online resources,
including user-focused improvements to the catalog and public website.
 D. Maintenance. Major program elements include enhanced resources to
provide regular care and major maintenance, such as repair or replacement of
structural elements and building systems, for the Library’s heavily-used buildings
as they age, to prolong their useful life and ensure they are clean, safe and
welcoming.
 These program elements are illustrative examples. The levy proceeds
will be spent in accordance with the annual City budget process for each year
of the levy. The City Librarian and Library Board shall submit to the Mayor and
City Council the Library Services and funding expenditure plan that will support,
maintain and improve the core Library Services identifi ed in this section. Each
year the Library Board shall adopt an annual operations plan and capital budget.
 Section 6. Reporting. The City Librarian and the Library Board will submit

calendar years 2014 through 2020.

Full text of Ordinance No. 17304
AN ORDINANCE providing for the submission to the qualifi ed electors of
King County at a special election to be held in King County on August 7,
2012, of a proposition authorizing a property tax levy in excess of the levy
limitation contained in chapter 84.55 RCW for a consecutive nine year period
at fi rst year rate of not more than $0.07 per one th ousand dollars of assessed
valuation, to fund capital costs of replacing the children and family justice
center located at 12th Avenue and East Alder Street in Seattle.
SECTION 1. Findings:
 A. Public safety is a fundamental purpose of government.
 B. A strong criminal justice system is necessary to maintain safe and
livable communities.
 C. Under Washington state law, counties provide many regional and
local criminal justice functions, including police protection, the incarceration
of offenders, court services, and the prosecution and defense services of
defendants.
 D. The children and family justice center (“CFJC”) facility at 12th
Avenue and East Alder Street in downtown Seattle serves the justice needs
of King County youth and families.
 E. The CFJC is in a state of disrepair and has reached the end of its
useful life. The costs of maintaining the buildings have become untenable
with over twenty million dollars in needed maintenance costs alone. The
facility is in need of replacement to ensure the continuing justice services for
King County children and families and to meet the demands of population
growth in future years.
 F. The superior court has undertaken long range planning efforts for
the provision of juvenile and family justice services and has completed both
a Targeted Operational Master Plan (“TOMP”) and a Targeted Facilities
Master Plan (“TFMP”) which recommended replacement of the CFJC and
improvements to the facilities to meet future demand.
 G. Planning efforts have also determined that replacement of the
detention facilities with a modern design will allow the county to optimize
operations to reduce operational costs and avoid necessary major
maintenance expenses on the existing facilities. Additionally, relocating the
placement of detention facilities on the site will maximize the residual value of
the remaining land.
 H. Current funding for criminal justice is limited and insuffi cient to
provide King County residents with the level of services needed to build and
maintain safe and strong communities and to all make the necessary updates
to criminal justice capital facilities, including the CFJC.
 I. To counter this shortfall and a general lack of funding for county
government, King County has aggressively worked to reduce expenditures
by consolidating departments and functions, reducing labor costs and
eliminating positions and programs.
 J. To save taxpayer dollars and have the greatest possible impact on
those in need, King County makes substantial investments in prevention
and intervention efforts that reduce criminal justice involvement and costs,
including job readiness, employment services and ending homelessness, in
conjunction with funding traditional criminal justice services.
 K. To contain costs and bring growth in revenues and expenditures
into equilibrium, King County has continued to fi nd effi ciencies and capitalize
on productivity gains through the better use of technology, better program
management and performance measurement.
 L. King County has also worked to obtain additional revenue tools from
the state Legislature to offset the structural funding problem facing King and
all other Washington state counties. However, these changes have not been
suffi cient to solve the county’s projected revenue shortfalls.
 M. The county’s projected future defi cits threaten important criminal
justice and other essential government functions.
 N. The county council hereby fi nds that essential public health and
safety services provided by the CFJC are of general benefi t to all of the
residents of King County. To maintain King County’s ability to continue to
provide services at a facility on the current site of the CJFC, the county
council fi nds that the best interests of all of the residents of the county require
the county to undertake a replacement project for the facility.
 O. The county council further fi nds that it is appropriate to ask the
voters to fund the replacement of this essential criminal justice facility through
a nine-year $0.07 property tax levy.
SECTION 2. Defi nitions. The defi nitions in this section apply
throughout this ordinance unless the context clearly require otherwise.
 A. “Children and family justice center replacement project” means
a capital project or series of capital projects to design, remodel, construct
and equip facilities for juvenile justice and family law services, including but
not limited to replacement of the Alder wing, tower, detention facilities, and
associated parking facilities located at the children and family justice center
necessary to replace and expand the existing county facilities located at 12th
and Alder in Seattle.
 B. “Capital costs” includes the costs of architectural, engineering, legal
and other consulting services, inspection and testing, administrative and
relocation expenses, site improvement, demolition, on and off-site utilities,
related improvements and other costs incurred incident to the design,
remodeling, construction and equipping of the children and family justice
center replacement project and its fi nancing, including the incidental costs
and costs related to the sale, issuance and delivery of the bonds. However,
“capital costs” shall not include the costs of maintenance or operations.
SECTION 3. Levy submittal. To provide necessary funds for the
capital costs for design, remodeling, construction and equipping of the
children and family justice center replacement project, the county council
shall submit to the qualifi ed electors of the county a proposition authorizing a
regular property tax levy in excess of the levy limitation contained in chapter
84.55 RCW for nine consecutive years, commencing in 2012, with collection
beginning in 2013, at a rate in the fi rst year not to $0.07 per one thousand
dollars of assessed value. In accordance with RCW 84.55.050, this levy
shall be a regular property tax levy, subject to the statutory rate limit of RCW
84.52.043
SECTION 4. Project description.
 A. The children and family justice center replacement project will
replace and expand of the Alder Tower, Alder Wing, detention facilities and
associated parking facilities of the existing facility located at 12th and Alder in
Seattle. The exact project specifi cations shall be determined by the county
council.
 B. The council estimates that the capital costs of design, remodeling,
construction and equipping of the children and family justice center
replacement project will be in the range of two hundred to two hundred ten
million dollars.
SECTION 5. Deposit of levy proceeds. If approved by the voters, the
levy proceeds shall be deposited in a fi rst tier fund that shall be established
by the council upon voter approval of the ballot measure. Proceeds from the
fund shall be used solely for any eligible purpose identifi ed in section 6 of this
ordinance.
SECTION 6. Eligible expenditures. If approved by the qualifi ed
electors of the county, the levy proceeds shall be used only for capital costs
for the children and family justice center replacement project.
SECTION 7. Call for special election. In accordance with RCW
29A.04.321, the King County council hereby calls for a special election to be
held in conjunction with the general election on August 7, 2012. The director
of elections shall cause notice to be given of this ordinance in accordance
with the state constitution and general law and to submit to the qualifi ed
electors of the county, at the said special county election, the proposition
