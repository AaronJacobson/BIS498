Explanatory Statement
Written by the Office of the Attorney General
The Law as it Presently Exists
Washington’s minimum wage for employees who are at
least 18 years old is $9.47 per hour for 2016. For employees under 18 years old, the Washington Department of
Labor and Industries sets the minimum wage. The Department has determined that workers who are 16 or 17 years
old must receive the adult minimum wage. Workers who
are under 16 years old may be paid 85% of the adult minimum wage, which for 2016 is $8.05 per hour. Employers
must pay overtime wages of at least one and one-half an
employee’s regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess
of 40 hours in a 7-day work week. Employers cannot use
tips as credit toward minimum wages owed to a worker.
Some cities have adopted local laws that require a higher
minimum wage within those cities. Where a higher local
minimum wage applies, the employer must pay the higher
minimum wage. If a federal or local law sets a lower minimum wage than the one required by state law, the higher
state minimum wage is the one that applies.
The Department of Labor and Industries calculates a cost
of living adjustment to the state minimum wage every fall,
and the new rate takes effect the following January 1. The
Department calculates the minimum wage increase according to the rate of inflation.
Most workers must be paid at least the minimum wage for
all hours worked. But some workers are not currently covered by the state Minimum Wage Act. For example, people
who are working as independent contractors, casual laborers, certain “white collar” professionals, and volunteers for
qualified organizations are not covered.
There are currently no state laws that require an employer
to provide paid sick leave. But some cities have passed local laws that require employers to provide paid sick leave.
Absent a local law requiring it, paid sick leave is considered
a benefit that an employer may choose to provide under an
agreement or policy.
Under Washington’s Family Care Act, if an employer offers
paid leave, their employees can use earned paid leave to
care for a sick family member. Covered family members
include children, parents, spouses, registered domestic
partners, parents-in-law, and grandparents.
In addition, there are federal and state laws that govern
when a worker can take unpaid leave. The federal Family
Medical Leave Act and the state Family Leave Act currently permit some workers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid
leave and still keep their jobs. To qualify, the worker must
have worked at least 12 months for the employer for a total
of at least 1,250 hours, and the employer must have 50 or
more employees. The unpaid leave can be used to recover
from the worker’s own serious illness, to care for a child,
spouse, or parent with a serious health condition, or to care
for a newborn child, newly adopted child, or foster child.
Under Washington’s domestic violence leave law, victims
of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking and their
family members can also take reasonable leave to take
care of legal or law enforcement needs, to seek treatment,
to obtain services, to relocate, or to take other action to
ensure the victim’s safety. The law does not require that
domestic violence leave be paid leave, but an employee
may choose to use paid leave if he or she has it.
The Department of Labor and Industries enforces Washington’s Minimum Wage Act and state leave laws and
adopts rules related to these laws.
The Effect of the Proposed Measure if Approved
Initiative 1433 would increase the hourly minimum wage
incrementally over four years and require employers to provide paid sick leave. The measure would also adopt related
laws about earning and using paid sick leave.
Initiative 1433 would increase the hourly minimum wage
for employees who are at least 18 years old to $11.00 on
January 1, 2017; $11.50 on January 1, 2018; $12.00 on
January 1, 2019; and $13.50 on January 1, 2020. The Department of Labor and Industries must still set the minimum wage for employees under 18 years old. Beginning
on January 1, 2021, the minimum wage rate would again
be adjusted each year according to the rate of inflation. If a
local law requires a higher minimum wage within a city, the
local minimum wage would apply.
Beginning on January 1, 2018, employers would be required to provide paid sick leave to employees covered by
the Minimum Wage Act. Employers would be required to
pay sick leave at the employee’s pay rate or at the new
minimum wage, whichever is higher. An employee would
get at least one hour of paid sick leave for every 40 hours
worked, but employers could provide more generous paid
leave. The measure would require employers to allow use
of paid sick leave after 90 days of employment. Sick leave
could be used to meet an employee’s own medical needs
or to care for a family member’s medical needs. Family
members would include: a spouse or registered domestic
partner; a child; a parent, step-parent, or legal guardian;
a grandparent; a grandchild; and a brother or sister. Paid
sick leave could also be used when the employee’s place
of business or their child’s school or childcare is ordered to
be closed for a health related reason. Paid sick leave could
be used for domestic violence leave.
Initiative Measure No. 1433
8 Initiative Measure No. 1433
An employer could require employees to give reasonable
notice when they want to take paid sick leave. Where
an absence from work will last longer than three days,
employers could also require verification that the employee
is taking leave for an authorized purpose. An employer
could not require an employee to search for or find a
replacement worker in order to be able to take paid sick
leave.
Employers would be required to provide their employees
with regular notice about the amount of paid sick leave they
have earned. Up to 40 hours of sick leave could be carried
over to the following year, and employers could allow more
carryover if they wish. Employers would not have to pay
employees for their unused sick leave when the employee
leaves. Where an employee leaves a job and is rehired by
the same employer within one year, previously earned sick
leave would have to be reinstated.
The measure would make the state Minimum Wage Act,
including its minimum wage, overtime, and new paid
sick leave requirements, expressly apply to people who
contract with the Department of Social and Health Services
to provide care to disabled people under certain programs.
But the measure does not otherwise expand the state
Minimum Wage Act to make it apply to other workers who
are not currently covered.
Employers would not be allowed to discriminate or retaliate
against an employee or impose discipline against an
employee for proper use of paid sick leave. An employee
could not agree to receive less than what he or she is
entitled to under the initiative. The Department of Labor
and Industries would enforce the new law and would have
to adopt rules for implementing and enforcing it.
Fiscal Impact Statement
Written by the Office of Financial Management
For more information visit www.ofm.wa.gov/ballot
Summary
Initiative 1433 would increase state revenues, and state and
local government expenditures, during the next six fiscal
years. State revenues would increase due to employers
making Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund tax payments
on higher wages. State General Fund expenditures would
decrease in the first four fiscal years, but increase in the
fifth and sixth fiscal years. Expenditures from all other
funds would increase in each fiscal year. Increases exceed
any decreases in State General Fund spending resulting
from the initiative. Local school district expenditures would
increase. Other local government expenditure impacts
cannot be estimated.
General Assumptions
•	 The initiative’s effective date is January 1, 2017. However, the paid sick leave requirement becomes effective on January 1, 2018.
•	 Unless otherwise noted, estimates use the state’s fiscal year of July 1 through June 30. For example, fiscal
year (FY) 2018 is July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018.
•	 Federal funds reported in this statement are only
those that are included in the state budget.
•	 A calendar year (CY) is January 1 through December 31.
•	 A school year is September 1 through June 30.
•	 One full-time equivalent (FTE) employee equates to
2,080 hours of work for one calendar year.
•	 Three cities have enacted a higher minimum wage
ordinance than is reflected in Initiative 1433 (I-1433).
This fiscal impact statement does not address
impacts of those ordinances.
•	 The cost of increases in the minimum wage is
calculated based on the minimum wage rates set
in I-1433, less the projected cost of increases in
the current state minimum wage law. The Office of
Financial Management projection of the minimum
wage under current law is shown below, together with
the required and projected amounts under I-1433.
Date Projected
Hourly Rate
Under
Current Law
Hourly
Rate
Under
I-1433
January 1, 2017 $9.55 $11.00
January 1, 2018 $9.77 $11.50
January 1, 2019 $10.02 $12.00
January 1, 2020 $10.28 $13.50
January 1, 2021 $10.56 $13.86
January 1, 2022 $10.83 $14.23
Initiative Measure No. 1433 9
•	 The inflation projection for FY 2021 is assumed at 2.7
percent and for FY 2022 is assumed at 2.6 percent.
State Revenue Assumptions
The Employment Security Department (ESD) collects taxes
from employers for the Unemployment Insurance (UI) Trust
Fund.
State Revenue
Increasing the minimum wage expands the taxable wage
base for many employers. This makes more wages subject
to the UI Trust Fund tax. Table 1 provides fiscal year estimates of additional UI Trust Fund tax collections.
(See Table 1 on page 13)
State Expenditure Assumptions
•	 No expenditure impact is assumed for agency employees covered under a current collective bargaining agreement that provides wages and benefits
that exceed the initiative requirements.
•	 State agencies and local governments purchase
goods and services through vendor contracts
managed by the Department of Enterprise Services.
If higher costs resulting from the initiative are passed
onto the state, vendors would likely increase the cost
of purchasing goods and services, but the amount of
the increase cannot be estimated.
•	 Expenditures from the State General Fund may be
used for any government purpose such as education;
social, health and environmental services; and other
general government activities.
State Expenditures
I-1433 affects multiple state agencies and institutions of
higher education. Impacts by agency for the minimum
wage increase and paid sick leave requirements are
summarized in Table 2. Additional detail and assumptions
for each agency’s estimated expenditures are explained
under each agency heading.
(See Table 2 on page 13)
Department of Labor and Industries
The Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) is required
to adopt and implement rules to carry out and enforce
I-1433. L&I will need an estimated 17.8 FTEs for such activities as investigating complaints for minimum wage and
sick leave violations, as well as for retaliation and discrimination claims; conducting outreach and communication of
new requirements to employers; programming information
technology; and rule making.
Table 3 provides estimated FTEs and expenditures for L&I
implementation costs.
(See Table 3 on page 14)
Department of Social and Health Services
I-1433 impacts multiple programs at the Department of
Social and Health Services (DSHS). Impacts are displayed
by program. To administer and operate these programs,
state expenditures are often matched with federal dollars
so both state and federal expenditure impacts are displayed, where applicable. For purposes of the fiscal impact
statement, only state expenditure impacts are considered
in the totals in Table 2 and in the fiscal impact summary in
Table 4.
The department contracts with a number of vendors who
provide services to children for child care and behavioral rehabilitation; to individuals in nursing homes requiring
care; to individuals who need long-term care; and to adults
requiring assistance with personal care at home, among
others. These include vendors who provide direct care to
clients living in the community in a variety of settings. Many
vendor contracts are paid on a performance-based deliverable basis or on an agreed-upon rate for a unit of service.
Table 4 summarizes impacts of I-1433 across all DSHS
programs.
(See Table 4 on page 14)
Economic Services Administration (DSHS)
I-1433 would result in fiscal impact to the Basic Food program and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
(TANF) program. The Basic Food program (formerly known
as food stamps) provides low-income individuals and families with food benefits. Approximately 2 percent of the Basic Food program funding is State General Fund, while the
remaining 98 percent is federal funds. The TANF program
provides temporary cash assistance for low-income families. Approximately 50 percent of the TANF program funding is State General Fund.
When an individual’s or family’s income increases, the
benefit amounts may be reduced, applications for benefits
may be denied and/or current recipients may be terminated from the program. Caseload impacts and cost savings
are estimated using actual caseload counts and wage income data from December 2015. Tables 5 and 6 summarize the impacts of I-1433 by program.
(See Tables 5 and Table 6 on page 14)
Developmental Disabilities Administration
and Aging and Long-Term Care Administration (DSHS)
The Home and Community Services division in the LongTerm Care Administration develops and pays for longterm care services for persons with disabilities and the
elderly, with priority given to low-income individuals and
families. Under the 2015–17 collective bargaining agree-
10 Initiative Measure No. 1433
ment with Service Employees International Union Healthcare 775NW, wages range from $12.00/hour to $15.65/
hour for services from a contracted individual provider for
children and adults assessed by DSHS and found eligible for Medicaid personal care. With respect to the wage
differences provided in the initiative, the current collective bargaining agreement for SEIU Healthcare 775NW
already meets or exceeds the amount required through
2019, as well as for Medicaid contracted home care
agencies. Thus, there would be no fiscal impact for individual providers from FY 2017 through FY 2019.
Table 7 displays projected impacts after FY 2019 for individual providers.
(See Table 7 on page 14)
Health Care Authority
I-1433 affects multiple Health Care Authority (HCA) programs. Table 8 provides a summary of all expected program impacts. These impacts are due to fewer people
being eligible for benefits. Each program is explained in
further detail that follows.
(See Table 8 on page 15)
HCA estimated the total impact to the affected Medicaid
populations using the budgeted state fiscal year per-capita rate multiplied by the affected population change for
each fiscal year. Per-capita rates are calculated twice a
year. It is likely this estimate will change with adjustments
to the Medicaid forecasted per-capita rates. Additionally, the FY 2017 per-capita rate does not assume any
changes in caseload mix, inflation or other factors. Table
9 displays the HCA estimated impacts on all Medicaid
programs. These impacts are due to fewer people being
eligible for benefits. (Table 9 is a subset of Table 8.)
(See Table 9 on page 15)
Family Medical Adults (HCA)
This program provides health care to adult caretakers
with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) eligibility
threshold of 54 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL).
Increasing the state minimum wage may cause some clients now covered by this program to lose eligibility and
then become eligible for the Newly Eligible Adult Group.
Increasing the state minimum wage may also cause current clients to exceed the income eligibility limits and thus
become eligible for non-Apple Health coverage through
the Health Benefit Exchange. This would likely result in
savings for the HCA. However, the full impacts will not
be realized until 2019, when the minimum wage reaches
$12.00 per hour. Any changes in the FPL and eligibility
requirements could change the impact to HCA and the
Medicaid program. Table 10 displays the impacts of the
minimum wage on Family Medical expenditures.
(See Table 10 on page 15)
Newly Eligible Adult Group (HCA)
This program provides health care to adults under the
Affordable Care Act with income up to 138 percent of
the FPL. Services for this population are largely federally
funded, and any changes in population size will have a
limited effect on state funds due to the small change in
the federal match rate. The federal match is anticipated
to change incrementally starting in 2017 until it reaches
90 percent in 2020. Any changes in the FPL and eligibility
requirements could change the impact to the HCA and
the Medicaid program. Table 11 shows the impact of the
minimum wage increase on the Newly Eligible Adult population.
(See Table 11 on page 15)
Various children’s programs (HCA)
Children become ineligible for Medicaid above 312 percent FPL under MAGI limits. Families at that income range
are less likely to be affected by a change in the minimum
wage until 2020, when the wage reaches $13.50 per hour.
Table 12 shows the impact of the minimum wage increase
on children’s programs.
(See Table 12 on page 15)
Department of Early Learning
The Department of Early Learning contracts with a
number of vendors to provide child care, preschool and
early learning services directly to children and families.
Many vendor contracts are paid on a performance-based
deliverable basis or on an agreed-upon rate for a unit of
service. In conjunction with state funds, many vendors
receive federal funding and private funding to operate their
full scope of business. Therefore, the potential impact for
these vendor contracts and rates cannot be estimated.
Institutions of Higher Education
The state higher education system comprises the baccalaureate sector (four-year institutions) and the community and technical college system (two-year schools).
The baccalaureate sector is the University of Washington,
Washington State University, Central Washington University, Eastern Washington University, The Evergreen State
College and Western Washington University. The community and technical college sector is 34 colleges located
across the state.
The vast majority of classified and professional employees working for four-year institutions are already earning
wage and benefit levels above those required in I-1433. 
Initiative Measure No. 1433 11
Employees who would be affected by the initiative are
primarily students, and temporary seasonal and hourly
employees. At the University of Washington, 12 percent
of employees potentially affected work in the University of
Washington Medicine system.
Higher Education Assumptions
For employees in institutions of higher education, the
following assumptions are built into the expenditure estimates:
•	 Wage estimates include the increased cost of
employee benefits (such as employer contributions
for Social Security) that are based on pay.
•	 Cost estimates were calculated by the baccalaureate
institutions and by the State Board for Community
and Technical Colleges, each on its own behalf.
•	 Higher education employees generally earn eight
hours of sick leave per month. They do not, however,
accrue that leave based on each 40 hours of work.
•	 Sick leave estimates include only those positions
that must be backfilled with a substitute worker
when someone is absent from work. Most positions
that would be affected by the initiative do not need
to be backfilled when those employees are sick.
To implement I-1433, most four-year institutions would
have some administrative costs, primarily for staff to track
employee leave under the initiative’s requirements. Table
13 provides cost estimates and FTEs by fiscal year.
(See Table 13 on page 15)
The costs of the minimum wage and sick leave backfill
are displayed in Table 14.
(See Table 14 on page 16)
K-12 education
The state allocates funding to school districts through formula-driven staff units and salaries, as defined in RCW
28A.150.260 and the omnibus appropriations act. I-1433
does not change the prototypical school staff ratios.
The current hourly salary allocation for certificated instructional staff is $24.79, for certificated administrative
staff is $29.23 and for classified staff is $16.06. These
allocations will continue to exceed the minimum hourly
wages identified in I-1433.
Salary allocations for certificated instructional staff are for
a full-time school year. Salary allocations for administrative and classified staff are for a full-time calendar year.
The funding is for allocation purposes and is not adjusted
based on actual days worked or number of days sick.
Therefore, no change is expected in allocations to school
districts related to the change in minimum wage or sick
leave entitlement under the initiative.
Employment Security Department
I-1433 will increase the average annual wage calculated
by the Employment Security Department, per state law.
As a result, minimum and maximum weekly unemployment benefit amounts will increase, meaning unemployment claimants could receive a higher weekly benefit
amount.
Table 15 provides fiscal year estimates of increased benefits payments to claimants.
(See Table 15 on page 16)
The combination of additional taxes and benefit payments results in an overall impact to the UI Trust Fund.
Note there is a four-year lag between collection of UI
taxes from employers and benefit payments. The tax is
based on a four-year experience rating factor (e.g., 2020
tax rates for employers are based on benefit charges between 2015 and 2019). However, the benefit payments
are paid immediately. Also, when there is a change in the
number of employers paying UI taxes into the Trust Fund,
the cost of benefit payments is spread among all paying
employers (called the social cost factor). The combination
of the lag between taxes and benefit payment as well as
the social cost factor leads to a net impact to the UI Trust
Fund.
Table 16 provides the total fiscal year impact to the UI
Trust Fund from the change in minimum wage.
(See Table 16 on page 16)
State employee compensation
The state will incur costs for implementing the change to
minimum wage, including increasing pay for those earning less than the minimum wage and the higher cost of
employee benefits (such as employer contributions for
Social Security) that are based on pay.
State employees, except for higher education employees, generally earn eight hours of sick leave per month.
They do not, however, accrue that leave based on each
40 hours of work. It is assumed that changes to the pattern of sick leave accrual to meet the requirements of
I-1433 can be made without a measurable increase in
the overall cost of sick leave, although there will likely be
some administrative work to implement the initiative’s requirements.
Table 17 displays the estimated impact for state employee
compensation due to the increase in the minimum wage.
(See Table 17 on page 16)
12
Local Government Revenue
There are no changes to local government revenue from
I-1433.
Local Government Expenditures
The expenditure impact of I-1433 on local governments
is indeterminate. The jurisdictions that could experience
the greatest expenditure impact from I-1433 are small local governments, such as towns, park districts and library
districts. This is due to their size and reliance on seasonal
or part-time employees whose current wage may be less
than the hourly rates specified in the initiative and who
may not currently accrue any sick leave.
For most jurisdictions, the impact of I-1433 is likely to be
minor (less than $50,000) to moderate (between $100,000
and $250,000). However, each jurisdiction could experience a range of impacts depending upon the number of
full- and part-time employees it employs and individual
sick leave policies.  Many, if not all, jurisdictions would
have minor one-time costs to update policies and payroll
systems.
Less information is available on sick leave accrual in local
government in Washington. Data from the 2015 Association of Washington Cities Salary and Benefits Survey,
which surveyed only permanent full-time local government employees, found that six jurisdictions, each a town
with a population fewer than 500, did not meet the minimum accrual level of paid sick leave required under the
initiative. 
No data is available to estimate the expenditure impact of
paid sick leave requirements for part-time and seasonal
local government employees.
Local School District Expenditure Assumptions
•	 School districts will continue to employ the same
number of individuals for the same number of hours
in future years.
•	 Current collective bargaining agreements offer more
sick leave to employees than required under I-1433.
Local School District Expenditures
In the 2015–16 school year, school districts employed
1,656 FTEs at hourly wages less than the minimum wage
amounts identified in I-1433. Fringe benefits are included in the estimated costs to school districts. To increase
salaries to the minimum wage identified in I-1433, school
district expenditures will increase as shown in Table 18.
No additional expenditures are incurred to comply with
sick leave requirements under I-1433.

Initiative Measure No. 1433 17
Argument for Argument against
Initiative 1433 is good for our workers, our families, and
our economy
Initiative 1433 ensures every Washington worker can earn
paid sick and safe leave and phases in a $13.50 minimum
wage by 2020.
Putting our health and safety first
Washingtonians should be able to take care of themselves
or a sick child without having to choose between their family
and a paycheck. It’s vitally important to pass a common
sense law like paid sick leave to help prevent the spread
of disease and keep customers, employees, children, the
elderly, and our families safe.
When restaurant, grocery, and childcare workers are forced
to go to work sick they expose our communities to disease.
In fact, 70% of food-related norovirus outbreaks are the
result of sick food workers showing up to work.
Creating more economic opportunity
Initiative 1433 would boost the income of more than 730,000
low-wage workers, lifting families out of poverty and growing the economy. When workers have more money to spend,
they spend it at local businesses. Initiative 1433 will inject
nearly $2.5 billion into local economies. This demand, in
turn, creates more good-paying jobs. That’s why every state
that raised the minimum wage in 2014 saw faster job growth
than those that left wages stagnant. Put simply, this initiative
helps businesses, workers, and families across Washington
thrive.
By voting “Yes” on Initiative 1433, we can make Washington
a better place to live, work, and raise a family.
Rebuttal of argument against
Initiative 1433 puts our health and safety first by providing
access to paid sick leave and creates economic opportunity.
Study after study – from independent economists including
the University of Washington – prove that prices do not rise
when minimum wages increase. Initiative 1433 saves the state
money and does not create new taxes for anyone. Instead, it
grows our economy and creates jobs as working families have
more money to spend in communities across the state.

We do need a minimum wage that benefits everyone –
workers, consumers and small businesses – a wage that
considers different costs of living across the state, the unique
pay structures of certain jobs, and the need for a training
wage for new workers. Unfortunately, I-1433 is a poorly crafted
proposal that will do more harm than good for workers and the
Washington economy.
Makes State Budget Problems Worse
The initiative raises $85 million in new taxes, but will increase
state spending by $363 million. The state is in contempt for
failing to fund education and must find billions of dollars to
fund our schools. This will make the problem worse.
Seattle Hasn’t Delivered
Seattle passed a $15 per hour minimum wage.  The City of
Seattle’s economists acknowledge the initial increase to $11
per hour has not benefitted workers. While average pay per
hour rose, workers are getting fewer hours and there are fewer
jobs available. Meanwhile, consumers are paying more for
less. Small businesses are hurting.
A University of Washington study warned most communities
around our state can’t absorb a 30% wage increase. This
means fewer jobs and small businesses, steeper prices in
stores, and less opportunity for young people to obtain work
experience.
We Can’t Afford The Risk
Washington State already has the 8th highest minimum wage.
This will make it more difficult for young people to find jobs.
Adding new mandates and jumping the minimum wage by
30% is a risk that workers, consumers and small businesses
can’t afford.  
Rebuttal of argument for
I-1433 takes the wrong approach – harming workers and
Washington’s economy. This proposal would cost jobs in
some communities while decreasing hours and take-home
pay for other workers. It would increase prices and reduce
opportunities for young people. Voters should be offended by
the backers’ use of scare tactics to distract from their hastily
designed plan — Washington's food handlers already operate
under strict laws requiring sick workers to stay home. Vote no
on I-1433.

residents to direct state funds to candidates; repeal the nonresident sales-tax exemption; restrict lobbying employment
by certain former public employees; and add enforcement
requirements.

Explanatory Statement
Written by the Office of the Attorney General
The Law as it Presently Exists
Candidates for elected offices pay for their campaigns
through private contributions and their own money. State
law limits some contribution amounts. These limits apply
to contributions from individuals, corporations, unions,
and political action committees. The contribution limit for
legislative candidates is $1,000 per election. For statewide
offices and judicial offices the contribution limit is $2,000
per election.
State law prohibits the use of public funds to finance political campaigns for state or school district offices. The statute does allow local governments to publicly finance local
political campaigns under certain circumstances.
Political campaigns are required to report contributions
and spending to the Public Disclosure Commission (PDC).
Political advertising must also disclose the top five contributors to the campaign. Reports of contributions and
expenditures are available to the public, including on the
PDC’s web site. Candidates are prohibited from coordinating their spending with other groups that support their
campaigns.
Candidates are generally prohibited from using contributions for personal use. Campaigns may reimburse candidates for earnings lost as a result of campaigning and for
direct out-of-pocket campaign expenses. If a candidate
loans money to his or her campaign, the campaign may
repay those loans up to a limit.
State law provides several ways campaigns may dispose
of surplus funds when a campaign is over. Surplus funds
may be returned to donors. They may also be used to reimburse the candidate for lost earnings. They may be transferred to a political party or caucus campaign committee,
but may not be transferred to another candidate or political
committee. They may also be donated to charity or to the
state. The campaign may hold the funds for possible future
use in another campaign for the same office. Finally, surplus funds may be used for expenses incurred in holding a
public office that are not otherwise reimbursed.
The PDC enforces campaign contribution and expenditure
laws. The PDC can do this through administrative orders.
The PDC may also refer charges to the Attorney General, who may bring actions in superior court to enforce the
law. An individual or entity found to have violated the law
is subject to financial penalties and liability for the state’s
investigative costs and attorney fees.
Lobbyists are currently required to register with the PDC.
Lobbyists are required to identify themselves and their
employers, the amount they are paid, and the subjects on
which they lobby. Lobbyists are also required to file monthly reports about their activities and compensation. They
must also report all contributions they make to candidates,
elected officials, and others.
Lobbyists and employers of lobbyists are required to inform the PDC if they employ certain people who remain
employed by the state. These include members of the
legislature, members of a state board or commission, and
full-time state employees. The state ethics act prohibits
all state employees from being paid by private parties for
performing (or failing to perform) their job duties. State employees are not allowed to receive any outside compensation that is incompatible with their jobs.
People who don’t live in Washington are exempt from paying sales taxes on items they buy in Washington for use out
of state. This exemption applies only if they live in states
or Canadian provinces that do not have their own sales
taxes or that exempt Washington residents from their sales
taxes.
The Effect of the Proposed Measure if Approved
This measure would make a number of changes to the
laws governing elections and lobbying.
It would establish a new program under which registered
voters and certain other eligible Washington residents
could make donations to campaigns for certain elected
offices using public funds. The law calls such donations
“democracy credit contributions.” Each individual could
designate up to three such “contributions” of $50 each to
qualified candidates they select every election. The PDC
could raise both the number and size of contributions in
the future.
All Washington registered voters could choose candidates
to receive contributions from public funds. Starting in 2020
the PDC may also verify others as eligible to choose candidates to receive such contributions. Only those eligible to
make campaign contributions under state and federal law
could be verified by the PDC as eligible. The right to designate contributions from public funds cannot be transferred,
and selling the right to designate contributions would be a
crime.
“Democracy credit contributions” would come from state
funds. The measure would repeal the nonresident sales tax
exemption and require nonresidents to pay the sales tax
on retail purchases in the state. Revenue from those sales
would be dedicated to funding the new program. Some
revenue could also be used to enforce campaign finance
laws. The measure would repeal the law that currently
Initiative Measure No. 1464
20 Initiative Measure No. 1464
prohibits using state funds for political campaigns.
The new public financing program would first apply only to
candidates for the state legislature. In the future, the PDC
could expand the program to statewide elected offices and
to judicial offices. It could later be expanded to apply to
candidates for federal office if the Attorney General concludes that such an expansion would be lawful. At first the
program would apply only to elections held in even-numbered years. The PDC could later expand it to elections
held in odd-numbered years.
To be eligible to receive public funding, candidates must
meet certain qualifications. Candidates must collect at
least 75 private contributions of at least $10. Candidates
must promise not to ask for or accept private donations that
exceed half of the maximum limit for the office they seek
(e.g., if the law limits individual contributions for a particular
office to $1,000, the candidate could only accept contributions up to $500). Candidates must also promise not to
use more than $5,000 of their personal funds on their campaign. Candidates could use public funds only for specified campaign purposes. The total amount of public funds
that any candidate could receive would be limited. Initial
limits would be $150,000 total for candidates for the state
House of Representatives and $250,000 for state Senate
candidates. Those limits could change in the future. Candidates would stop being eligible to receive contributions if
their campaign ends or if they violate program rules. At the
end of a campaign, candidates would be required to give
back to the state the proportionate part of the campaign’s
surplus funds that came from program contributions.
In addition to creating the new program concerning public
financing of campaigns, the measure would change several state laws regarding campaign finance and lobbying.
The initiative would limit lobbyists’ ability to hire officials
who previously worked in state or local government. This
includes elected officials, appointed officials, and public
employees. They could not accept employment or receive
compensation from any lobbyist who lobbied on any matter in which the official had any decision-making role for
three years after the official left office or five years after the
lobbying, whichever is sooner.
It would also restrict lobbying by former state or local elected or appointed officials. They could not be paid to lobby
their prior office within three years of leaving office. And
it would prohibit officers of a candidate’s campaign from
being paid to lobby the office to which their candidate was
elected until three years after working for the campaign.
The initiative would add new restrictions on certain campaign contributions. Public contractors and prospective
public contractors would have a lower contribution limit
for contributing to candidates for an office having a decision-making role over the contract. The same would be
true for lobbyists making contributions to candidates for
offices responsible for matters they lobby about. Their
contributions to such candidates would be limited to $100
per election. They would also be prohibited from gathering contributions from other people and giving them to the
candidate. They would not be allowed to solicit other people for contributions for the candidate of more than $100
each or $500 total. They would also be prohibited from soliciting contributions for the candidate from their employees. And they would be prohibited from doing business
with the candidate.
The measure would provide new ways to enforce the new
and existing campaign finance laws. The penalties for candidates or campaigns that recklessly or intentionally violate campaign finance laws would be increased. The PDC
would be authorized to require violators to take actions to
remedy their violations, in addition to paying money. Penalty money would be directed half to the state treasury generally and half to the PDC. The half directed to the PDC
would be designated for enforcement of campaign finance
laws. The initiative would allow the PDC to assess costs of
investigation and attorney fees against people who intentionally violate campaign finance laws. It would broaden
the range of people who might be required to pay penalties for violations and restrict the use of campaign funds to
pay penalties. It would shorten the notice period for private
parties intending to file lawsuits alleging violations of campaign finance laws during the 60 days before an election.
It would require the PDC to establish a telephone hotline
for receiving tips of violations and require certain people to
post notices of the hotline. It would establish new requirements for the PDC’s web site. It would change requirements for online filing of reports with the PDC by government agencies and lobbyists.
The measure would also change the requirement for identifying the top five contributors in political advertising and
other campaign communications. If the top five contributors include a political committee, then the top five contributors to the political committee must be identified and
disclosed as if they had contributed directly to the sponsor
of the advertising or communication.
The measure would modify the law against coordination
of campaigns by candidates and other entities. It would
create a presumption that candidates coordinate spending with others under certain circumstances.

Summary
During the first six fiscal years, the estimated net new revenues to the state General Fund from the repeal of the nonresident retail sales tax exemption is $173.2 million. The
estimated net impact of transfers and expenditures from
the state General Fund is $171.5 million. Of this amount,
$165.0 million represents transfers from the state General
Fund to the Campaign Financing and Enforcement Fund
for the Democracy Credit Program. Revenue for the Performance Audits of Government Account would increase
by $279,000. Local tax revenue would increase by $67.3
million.

•	 The effective date of the initiative is December 8,
2016.
•	 Unless otherwise noted, estimates use the state’s
fiscal year (FY) of July 1 through June 30. For example,
FY 2018 is July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018.
•	 FY 2017 is a partial fiscal year: from December 8,
2016, through June 30, 2017.
•	 One full-time equivalent (FTE) employee equates to
2,080 hours of work for one calendar year.
State Revenue Assumptions
•	 Businesses will fully comply with the elimination of
the retail sales tax exemption for nonresidents beginning February 1, 2017.
•	 FY 2017 state retail sales tax revenue reflects four
months of collections, from March 2017 through
June 2017.
State revenue impacts
Initiative 1464 (I-1464) repeals a retail sales tax exemption
for certain nonresidents on purchases of tangible personal
property, digital goods and digital codes that will not be
used in the state. This would increase sales tax revenues
deposited in the state General Fund and the Performance
Audits of Government Account. Revenues deposited in the
state General Fund may be used for any government purpose such as education; social, health and environmental
services; and other general government activities.
In addition, the repeal of the nonresident retail sales tax exemption could affect the amount of goods purchased. This
could cause price elasticity, which would affect state business and occupation (B&O) tax revenue. Price elasticity is
a method used to calculate the change in consumption of
a good when price increases or decreases. Due to price
elasticity, state B&O tax revenue could decrease with the

repeal of the retail sales tax exemption for nonresidents.
Table 1 provides estimates of the new revenue to the state
General Fund, reflecting both increased sales tax revenue
and decreased B&O tax revenue.
(See Table 1 on page 23)
A portion of state retail sales tax revenue is deposited in
the state Performance Audits of Government Account
(Performance Audit Account). Table 2 provides estimates
of the increased retail sales tax revenue over the next six
fiscal years to this account. State revenues deposited in
the Performance Audit Account are used by the Washington State Auditor to conduct comprehensive performance
audits required under RCW 43.09.470.
(See Table 2 on page 23)
State Transfer and Expenditure Assumptions
•	 FY 2017 expenditures are for January 2017 through
June 2017 only.
•	 25 percent of the amount transferred to the Campaign Financing and Enforcement Fund (Fund) would
be appropriated to cover Public Disclosure Commission (PDC) agency costs. If the amount needed from
the Fund for PDC expenses is less than 25 percent of
the transfer amount, the remaining amount would be
available for the Democracy Credit Program.
Transfers to the Campaign Financing and
Enforcement Fund
I-1464 creates the Campaign Financing and Enforcement
Fund (Fund). Funds in the account are subject to legislative
appropriation and must be used for the Democracy Credit
Program and the democracy credit contributions created
by I-1464 and to support activities of the PDC.
The Department of Revenue (DOR) would estimate the
amount of state revenue resulting from repealing the nonresident retail sales tax exemption and then certify the
estimated amount to the State Treasurer. The DOR would
make these estimates and certifications on March 1, 2017,
and again on June 1, 2017. Subsequently, the DOR would
make the estimate and certification by June 1 each year
thereafter.
For FY 2017, the State Treasurer is required to transfer
$15.0 million from the state General Fund to the Fund. Beginning in FY 2018 and for each fiscal year thereafter, the
State Treasurer must transfer $30.0 million from the state
General Fund to the Fund.
If repeal of the nonresident retail sales tax generates less
revenue than what the State Treasurer is required to transfer, additional state General Fund dollars equal to the difference must be transferred. At least 75 percent of the money
in the Fund must be used for democracy credit contribu-
22
Expenditures for the Democracy Credit Program
Each even-numbered year, the PDC would mail personalized materials about the program to each registered voter.
Currently, there are more than 4 million registered voters in
Washington. After the first mailing, and up to 10 days before the general election, the PDC would mail program materials to each newly registered voter. I-1464 sets detailed
requirements for what must be included in the mailing.
These requirements, and the large number of voters who
will receive the materials, contribute to the cost of conducting the mailing. The mailing would require expenditures for
paper, printing informational materials and official PDC envelopes, and postage.
Section 16 of I-1464 directs the PDC to contract for the
development and implementation of a secure electronic
system for conducting all technical aspects of the program. The system must be internet accessible and run on
computers and mobile devices. Eligible individuals would
use it to make secure democracy credit contributions.
Building the system would cost an estimated $2.0 million.
This estimate includes contracts with a qualified information technology development firm, IT consultant services,
IT quality assurance services and the first year of system
maintenance.
The PDC would also have higher expenditures for hiring
additional staff to operate the program, conducting the required public outreach and education efforts, maintaining
a website for the program that complies with the initiative,
maintaining a telephone hotline, auditing the campaign finances of at least 2 percent of the state candidates participating in the program, developing administrative rules
and enforcing program requirements. These expenses are
included in Table 4 – FTE Costs and Other Costs.
Office of the Attorney General
As the provider of legal services to the PDC, the ATG
would have additional expenditures for legal advice, litigation costs and rule making related to the new enforcement
mechanisms provided to the PDC, including:
•	 Increases in the number of complaints for rules violations submitted to the PDC.
•	 Increases in the number of citizen action complaints
to the PDC.
•	 Rule making to take effect for the 2017 campaign
season.
Table 6 provides estimates of the costs of providing these
legal services to implement the initiative.
(See Table 6 on page 24)
Section 14(2) of I-1464 requires the ATG to provide an opinion about whether the program can be lawfully expanded
tions. The remaining 25 percent may be appropriated by
the Legislature to the PDC for program operating costs.
Table 3 shows the required transfers under I-1464 to the
Fund and the net impact to the state General Fund before
additional state expenditures.
(See Table 3 on page 23)
State Expenditures
I-1464 would change current campaign finance disclosure
laws, set new contribution limits and create the Democracy
Credit Program. These changes would result in additional
expenditures for the PDC and the Office of the Attorney
General (ATG). The greater workload for these agencies
would result in higher expenditures, though costs would
decrease in the future. The DOR would have higher expenditures in the first two years of implementation. Table
4 summarizes these estimated expenditures by fiscal year.
(See Table 4 on page 23)
Public Disclosure Commission
The PDC would have higher expenditures to implement
and operate the Democracy Credit Program and to implement and enforce new lobbying and campaign finance
requirements. Table 5 summarizes these estimated expenditures.
(See Table 5 on page 24)
Based on PDC estimated expenditures and the assumption that up to 25 percent of the Fund transfer amount
shown in Table 3 would be used to cover these expenditures, there would be a need for additional state General
Fund expenditures in FY 2018 of $1.2 million.
Expenditures for additional staff
Staff expenditures include campaign finance specialists,
investigators, regulatory analysts, a records and rules coordinator, a graphic designer, communications consultants,
budget and fiscal analysts, IT specialists, customer service
specialists, managers and administrative assistants. As the
PDC’s current office space is not large enough to accommodate current and new staff, it would need to lease additional office space in Thurston County.
Expenditures for new lobbying and campaign
finance requirements
I-1464 establishes new restrictions on lobbying and lobbyists, on campaign contributions and expenditures, and on
disclosure of campaign finance information. It would permit anonymous reporting of violations, requiring the PDC
to maintain a telephone tip hotline. I-1464 also requires the
PDC and the ATG to prioritize timely enforcement of campaign finance laws and rules.
Initiative Measure No. 1464
Initiative Measure No. 1464 23
in FY 2022. About 90 hours of an Assistant Attorney General’s time (0.05 FTE) to develop and issue the legal opinion
is estimated.
Department of Revenue
The DOR would incur expenditures of $64,000 in FY 2017
and $19,000 in FY 2018 to implement repeal of the nonresident sales tax exemption. These expenditures would be
used to create a special notice to and provide assistance
for affected taxpayers.
Local government revenue
Local governments assess a local retail sales tax on purchases. Local government revenue would increase from
the repeal of the nonresident sales tax exemption. Table 7
provides estimates of increased retail sales tax revenues to
local governments.
(See Table 7 on page 24)
Local government expenditures
No local government expenditures are expected.

Initiative Measure No. 1464 25
Argument for Argument against
Big money interests and lobbyists have too much control
over our political system, while regular people have very little.
Initiative 1464 implements concrete, achievable reforms to
make politicians and government more accountable to the
people.
Transparency and Accountability
Initiative 1464 sheds light on dark money and SuperPACs
by requiring political ads say who is really paying for them. It
requires online public reporting of lobbyist activity, spending
and compensation.
Limits Big Money Influence
Initiative 1464 bars lobbyists and public contractors from
making big campaign contributions. It stops the revolving
door of government officials taking jobs as lobbyists as soon
as they leave office. It toughens enforcement of ethics and
campaign finance laws, and strengthens penalties for those
who break them.
Empowers Voters
Initiative 1464 gives regular people a stronger voice by
enabling each person to decide if they want to direct some
of their own tax dollars to support candidates of their choice.
This also helps new types of candidates run for office even if
they aren’t wealthy or well-connected to big donors.
A Big Step for Washington
If we want things to change, we have to reform the campaign
finance system so regular people have more power in politics.
Initiative 1464 makes commonsense reforms proven to work
in other states and pays for itself by closing a tax loophole. We
can’t fix every problem or get all money out of politics, but if
we do nothing, nothing will change. This is a big step in the
right direction.
Rebuttal of argument against
Initiative 1464 requires transparency and accountability, limits
big money influence, strengthens rules on  all  lobbyists and
politicians, and empowers each taxpayer to decide whether
or not to direct funds to candidates. The fiscal impact
statement and Washington Budget and Policy Center agree:
It doesn’t  take money from schools and doesn’t hurt jobs.
Sadly, the lobbyists who wrote the arguments against 1464
are not required to tell the truth. Read about 1464 and decide
for yourself.

Initiative 1464 uses your tax dollars to tilt the political system
in favor of politicians and out of state special interests, while
depriving our schools of resources to fully fund education. We
shouldn’t put politicians before our kids.
Benefits Politicians and Political Consultants
The initiative allows politicians to pay themselves for “lost
wages” using public funds. Taxpayer dollars will be used
to pay politicians to run for office. The system will be ripe for
abuse. It’s no surprise the initiative is sponsored by politicians
and political consultants who will personally benefit from the
use of taxpayer funds. It is funded by billionaires and out-ofstate special interests trying to create an uneven playing field
in their favor.
Wrong Priorities
Our state is under court order to fully fund education and is
subject to a $100,000 per day fine. Instead of funding our
schools, the initiative gives $285 million in taxpayer money to
political consultants and politicians to spend on mudslinging
and negative attack ads.
The initiative allows people living in Washington who
are non-citizens to contribute taxpayer dollars to politicians,
even though they can’t vote.
Hurts Small Businesses, But Exempts Special Interests
The initiative hurts Washington small businesses by raising
$285 million in taxes on their customers over the next ten
years.  This will hurt tourism and kill jobs. The initiative also
restricts free speech for minority-owned small businesses but
provides exemptions for corporate lobbyists. Powerful special
interests get special treatment. Vote no on this bad idea.
Rebuttal of argument for
Despite claims by I-1464’s out-of-state backers, Washington is
already nationally recognized as being a leader on transparency
and ethical reporting. I-1464 would wreck that. The initiative
pours money into politics, giving $285 million in taxpayer
dollars to politicians instead of our schools. It will raise taxes on
Washington businesses, hurt our tourism industry and attack
the rights of minority small business owners while providing
loopholes for corporate lobbyists. Reject this bad idea.

Explanatory Statement
Written by the Office of the Attorney General
The Law as it Presently Exists
Washington law provides for civil protection orders in certain circumstances. These orders restrict one person from
contacting another person. Civil protection orders are
mostly entered in family law cases, such as divorce proceedings, where domestic violence is alleged. Protection
orders also can be issued to protect victims during criminal cases and in other circumstances where a person can
show he or she is in danger from another person.
A person subject to a protection order may be required
to surrender his or her firearms, dangerous weapons, and
concealed pistol license while the order is in place. This
can happen if four conditions are met: (1) the order restrains the person from harassing, stalking, or threatening
an intimate partner, a child of an intimate partner, or the
person’s own child (an “intimate partner” is a current or former spouse or domestic partner, a person with whom the
restrained person has a child in common, or a person with
whom the restrained person shares or shared a residence
in a dating relationship); (2) the order includes a finding
that the restrained person is a credible threat to the physical safety of the intimate partner or the child; (3) the order
specifically restrains the person from using or threatening
physical force against the intimate partner or child; and (4)
the restrained person was given notice and an opportunity
to participate in a hearing before the order issued. It is a
crime for a person restrained by such an order to possess
a firearm.
A court sometimes may order the temporary surrender
of firearms before a hearing and without prior notice. The
court may do so only if convinced that “irreparable injury”
could result before the scheduled hearing. This option is
available to the court only for protection orders addressing
sexual assault, stalking, harassment, domestic violence,
dissolution of marriage, parental rights, and child support.
There are other situations where a court may order a person to surrender firearms, dangerous weapons, and a concealed pistol license. A court may order surrender if it finds
that the person used, displayed, or threatened to use them
in a felony. The court also may order surrender if the person committed fourth degree assault, coercion, stalking,
reckless endangerment, or first degree criminal trespass
against a family or household member. If the evidence is
clear and convincing, the court must order the surrender.
A person who has been involuntarily committed for mental
health treatment is barred from possessing a firearm. After
treatment, that person’s right to possess a firearm may be
restored by court order. But the law does not authorize a
court to restrict access to firearms by a person experiencing a mental health crisis or exhibiting threatening behavior
unless that person is subject to one of the civil protection
orders summarized above.
The Effect of the Proposed Measure if Approved
The measure would allow courts to issue “extreme risk
protection orders.” These orders would prevent a person
who poses a significant danger to himself/herself or others
from possessing or accessing firearms. The measure refers to such a person as the “respondent.”
The measure would create two kinds of court orders. The
first type of order is called an “extreme risk protection order.” A member of the respondent’s family or household or
a person in a dating relationship with the respondent could
petition a superior court for an extreme risk protection
order. The measure defines who is a family or household
member and it lists specific information that must be contained in the petition. The petition must be accompanied
by a statement made under oath. That statement must explain the specific facts that show a reasonable fear of future dangerous acts by the respondent. The petition would
be served on the respondent by a law enforcement officer.
A law enforcement officer or agency also could file a petition, along with the required factual statement made under oath. The officer or agency must make a good faith
attempt to notify a member of the respondent’s family or
household. They also must try to notify any other known
person who may be at risk of violence by the respondent.
Each notice must state that the officer or agency is petitioning for an extreme risk protection order. It also must
include referrals to mental health, domestic violence, counseling, or similar resources.
The superior court must hold a hearing on the petition for
the protection order. The court may issue the order only if it
finds, based on the evidence, that the respondent “poses a
significant danger of causing personal injury to self or others by having in his or her custody or control, purchasing,
possessing, or receiving a firearm.”
If the superior court issues an extreme risk protection order, the order is served on the respondent by a law enforcement officer. The order would require the respondent
to immediately surrender all firearms and any concealed
pistol license to the local law enforcement agency. The order would bar the respondent from obtaining or possessing firearms while an order is in effect. If the respondent
does not comply, the court would be authorized to issue a
warrant to compel the surrender of these items.
An extreme risk protection order would last for one year.
Initiative Measure No. 1491
28
The same persons who may seek an order in the first place
may ask the court to renew the order for another year. The
same procedures and requirements apply to a renewal request as to the original request, and the court applies the
same standard.
The respondent could request a hearing to demonstrate
that the order should be terminated. The respondent could
file one termination request during each 12-month period
the order is in effect. The respondent then must demonstrate at the hearing that he or she does not pose a significant danger of causing personal injury to the respondent
or others by having a firearm. The person who petitioned
for the order must be notified of the request and hearing.
The second type of order, called an “ex parte extreme risk
protection order,” would be more immediate. “Ex parte” is
a legal term that refers to a hearing held without notice to
the other side. This type of order would be available where
there is a showing of a significant risk of personal injury in
the near future. A petition for this order could be filed in
municipal court, district court, or superior court. The court
must hold a hearing on the day the petition is filed or on the
court’s next business day. If the court issues the ex parte
order, it would last only until there is a hearing in superior
court on whether a one-year “extreme risk protection order” should be issued. That hearing must be held within 14
days. All the requirements for issuing a one-year “extreme
risk protection order” explained above would apply at that
hearing.
The measure would impose the same notice and surrender
requirements for an ex parte extreme risk protection order
as for the one-year order. The measure imposes the same
consequences for failure to comply. Like the one-year order, the ex parte order also would be served on the respondent by a law enforcement officer.
The measure makes it a crime to file a false or intentionally
harassing petition. It also makes it a crime to violate either
type of extreme risk protection order.
If an extreme risk protection order expires or is terminated,
the surrendered firearms must be returned to the respondent, but only if the law enforcement agency holding the
firearms confirms that the respondent is currently eligible
to possess firearms under federal and state law.
Fiscal Impact Statement
Written by the Office of Financial Management
For more information visit www.ofm.wa.gov/ballot
Summary
Initiative 1491 authorizes the court to issue extreme risk
protection orders that require the respondent to surrender
his/her firearms and concealed pistol license. Total expenditures for state and local government cannot be determined. The impact depends on the number of petitions
filed and granted, and the number of violations of a granted
order, which cannot be estimated. This fiscal impact statement uses data from similar types of protection orders to
provide estimated costs that could result from the initiative. There would be an unknown revenue increase from
assessed fines.
General Assumptions
•	 The effective date of the initiative is December 8,
2016.
•	 Unless otherwise noted, estimates use the state’s fiscal year (FY) of July 1 through June 30. For example,
FY 2018 is July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018.
•	 FY 2017 is a partial fiscal year: from December 8,
2016, through June 30, 2017.
•	 One full-time equivalent (FTE) employee equates to
2,080 hours of work for one calendar year.
State and Local Government Expenditure
Assumptions
•	 Initiative 1491 (I-1491) creates the authority for a court
to issue a new protection order, known as an extreme
risk protection order (ERPO).
•	 No data is available to determine the number of cases that will be filed with the court and the number of
orders that will subsequently be issued.
•	 In some instances, information on similar protection
orders may be available. These data may be used to
estimate some expected costs.
State Expenditures
I-1491 would result in indeterminate fiscal impacts to the
Department of Licensing, the Department of Corrections
and the Administrative Office of the Courts.
Department of Licensing
Section 12 of I-1491 requires the Department of Licensing
(DOL), upon the receipt of an ERPO from the court, to
determine if the respondent has a concealed pistol license.
If the respondent has a concealed pistol license, the DOL is
required to immediately notify the license-issuing authority
in order to revoke the license. This work is similar to work
already conducted by the DOL and would require less than
Initiative Measure No. 1491
29
0.1 FTE and less than $7,000 per year to accomplish. In
addition, the printing and postage costs for notification
to license-issuing authorities of issuance of an ERPO are
estimated to be $1 per ERPO. There is no data to estimate
the number of ERPOs that would be issued.
Department of Corrections
I-1491 creates a new felony offense for a person who is
convicted of violating an ERPO and has two or more previous convictions for violating an ERPO. The creation of
this new felony may increase the offender population. As
an unranked class C felony, this crime is punishable by a
standard range term of confinement of zero to 12 months
in jail unless an aggravated exceptional sentence is imposed. Sentences for this new offense would likely affect
only county jail facilities. There would be no increase in
state expenditures in cases where the sentence is served
in a county jail facility.
Depending on the circumstances, a judge may impose an
aggravated exceptional sentence. There is no data to estimate the increase to the prison offender population resulting from this action. However, the cost estimate to the
state for one offender is $13,422 annually, which includes
staffing in the housing units, food and health care.
Administrative Office of the Courts
I-1491 creates a new protection order and establishes new
crimes, both the above-referenced felony and misdemeanors for violation of the order and for filing petitions with false
information. There is insufficient judicial data to determine
how many cases would be filed each year as a result of
this initiative. The Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC)
used data for similar cases to provide estimated costs that
may result from the initiative. Based upon these comparisons, the AOC assumes that I-1491 would result in indeterminate expenditures greater than $100,000.
Domestic violence protection orders
An average of 17,435 domestic violence protection orders
are filed annually. The AOC assumes that the number of
new cases filed for an ERPO will be approximately 5 percent of the number of domestic violence protection order
cases. Therefore, the AOC assumes there will be 872 new
cases filed in superior court each year for an ERPO. Superior court expenditures are funded by state and local funds.
The state costs for the assumed number of new cases are
estimated to be $63,593 per fiscal year.
Stalking protection orders
An average of 386 petitions for stalking protection orders
are filed annually. The AOC assumes there will be approximately the same number of ERPOs. The state costs for
the assumed number of new cases are estimated to be
$28,150 per fiscal year.
New crimes and more cases filed
Section 13 of the initiative creates a new gross misdemeanor for providing false information in a petition and for
a person possessing firearms with knowledge that the respondent is prohibited from doing so by an ERPO. Section
13 also creates a class C felony on the third instance of
violating the provisions of an ERPO. This would amend the
felony of unlawful possession of a firearm in the second
degree to include those who possess a firearm when subject to this new protection order.
There is no judicial data available to estimate how many
cases would be filed each year as a result of this initiative. If
50 more criminal cases are filed, the superior courts would
see higher expenditures. The state costs are estimated to
be $5,926 per fiscal year.
Forms and informational materials
Section 16 of the initiative requires the AOC to develop and
prepare instructions; informational brochures; standard
petitions and extreme risk protection order forms; and
a court staff handbook on the ERPO process. These
materials must be prepared in consultation with gun
violence prevention groups, judges and law enforcement
personnel. Forms, brochures and handbooks would be
distributed to elected clerks and court administrators in
superior, district and municipal courts in electronic format.
Development of instructional materials and translation
costs are estimated at $25,000, depending on final word
counts, cost per word per language and number of required languages for translation.
System modifications
The initiative requires modification to the Judicial Information System to add codes for the protection order and new
crimes created by this initiative. The modifications are estimated to take 239 hours of staff time, resulting in a onetime cost of $13,000.
Local Government Expenditures
Law enforcement costs
Local government may have higher costs to fulfill duties in
the initiative. However, due to the lack of data to determine
the level of activity, the expenditure impact to local governments cannot be determined. Based on data from domestic violence protection orders, local governments estimate that new misdemeanor violations of ERPOs would
cost approximately $300,000 statewide annually. The cost
for most jurisdictions is estimated to be less than $50,000
annually.
According to the Washington Association of Sheriffs and
Police Chiefs, 9,883 instances of violations of no contact/
Initiative Measure No. 1491
30 Initiative Measure No. 1491
protection orders involved domestic violence in 2015. An
officer may spend up to four hours to arrest an individual charged with a domestic violence crime, at an average
cost of $31 per hour. Additional work for prosecutors when
charging and appearing at the sentencing for an offender
typically takes three hours, at an average cost of $62 per
hour. Local governments assume ERPO violations would
compose approximately 5 percent of domestic violence
protection orders, resulting in 494 ERPOs annually.
•	 Total cost to law enforcement: $61,256 annually
(4 hours x 494 violations x $31 hourly wage)
•	 Related prosecution costs: $91,884 annually
(3 hours x 494 violations x $62 hourly wage)
For a person with two or more previous convictions for violating an ERPO, the third convicted violation constitutes a
class C felony. It is not possible to determine the number of
felonies that would result from this initiative. However, local
governments estimate the number would be low and result
in costs of less than $50,000.
The new class C felony charge and misdemeanor charges
that may result from this legislation create an indeterminate
cost to county jails. Misdemeanor charges carry jail sentences of 0 to 90 days. Sentences of less than one year in
length are typically served in county jails. The average cost
of a jail bed is $104 per day. The new class C felony charge
that would result from three ERPO violation convictions
may be punishable by a range of one to three months in jail
and 51 to 68 months in prison.
Judicial costs
I-1491 would result in indeterminate fiscal impacts to local
courts, based on information from the AOC and using the
same comparisons to similar types of protection orders.
Assuming the number of ERPOs would be 5 percent of domestic violence protection orders, and equal to the number
of stalking protection orders, the cost to local courts would
be $401,205. Due to new crimes and more cases filed,
local superior courts could see an additional increase of
$25,917 per fiscal year. Based on these assumptions, the
total expenditure increase to local courts may be $427,122
per fiscal year.
State and Local Revenues
Section 13 creates two new misdemeanors and a new felony. A person convicted of filing a petition knowing the information is false, or convicted of possessing or purchasing
a firearm with knowledge that he or she is prohibited from
doing so (gross misdemeanors), may be subject to a fine
of up to $5,000. A person convicted of violating an ERPO
who has two or more previous ERPO violation convictions,
which is a class C felony, may be subject to a fine of up to
$10,000. Fines may be assessed, reduced or waived at the
discretion of the judge. Therefore, revenue from these fines
cannot be estimated. 
Initiative Measure No. 1491 31
Argument for Argument against
Washington State has taken important steps to keep guns
out of dangerous hands. But there are still gaps in our laws
that make it hard to keep guns away from people threatening
violence against themselves or others. We know that the
majority of mass shooters and individuals who attempt suicide
show signs of their intentions, but current law leaves families
and law enforcement - often first to see those warning signs -
unable to take life-saving action.
Initiative 1491: Empower Families, Prevent Gun Violence
Initiative 1491 empowers families and law enforcement to
prevent tragedy -- giving them a chance to remove guns from
a dangerous situation when they know someone is a threat
to themselves or others. Parents of shooters at Isla Vista,
Seattle’s Cafe Racer, and other tragedies have said they could
have used this type of law to prevent senseless violence.
Initiative 1491 would also expand protections that keep guns
out of the hands of domestic abusers. Similar laws in other
states have been shown to prevent some suicides.
Initiative 1491: Respect Due Process
Initiative 1491 closely follows existing process for other civil
protection orders. Both parties may present evidence in court.
A judge determines whether evidence of danger is sufficient
and issues an order, effective for one year. There are criminal
penalties for false petitions.
Initiative 1491: Community Support
Endorsed by Washington State Public Health Association,
League of Women Voters, Faith Action Network, Everytown
for Gun Safety, law enforcement, domestic violence experts,
gun owners, and gun violence survivors.
Rebuttal of argument against
Initiative 1491 fills a critical need in Washington’s proven,
established protection order system. It simply gives families
a tool to save lives— keeping guns from loved ones who
are likely to use them for violence to themselves or others.
Initiative 1491 is a targeted, tested way to keep guns out of
dangerous hands and respect due process—endorsed by
mental health professionals, law enforcement and suicide
prevention advocates.

I-1491 Duplicates Existing Laws
I-1491 disregards existing state laws that already require
treatment and restriction of potentially dangerous individuals.
I-1491 doesn’t require evaluation, treatment, or monitoring
and does nothing to address underlying issues. Recently implemented laws actually provide early detection and intervention of persons at danger to themselves or others.
Stigmatizes Mental Illness
I-1491 associates mental illness with mass shootings and violent crime. Statistics show that only 3%-5% of violent acts
are committed by people with serious mental illness. The vast
majority of people with mental illness are not violent and are
ten times more likely to be victims of violent crime than the
general population.
Violates Rights
A broadly defined set of people, including former roommates
and police, can file a petition against you. Due process is undermined by allowing immediate ex parte orders; hearings and
judgments without notice to the accused person. The definition of “Extreme Risk” is unclear. A judge can issue an order
based on arbitrary factors and reported behaviors including
simply purchasing a gun legally. To be released from an order,
a person must prove he/she is not a danger to themselves or
others and pay for the tremendous cost of their own defense.
Gives False Sense of Security
There is no evidence that such orders reduce mass shootings
and violent crime.
Restrictions on firearm ownership should not be based on
ideological agendas manipulating public fears and misconceptions about gun violence. I-1491 is a targeted, discriminatory abridgement of Second Amendment rights. Vote No!
Rebuttal of argument for
Ineffective! We all want to reduce tragedy, but I-1491 doesn’t
include treatment of allegedly dangerous people, and
doesn’t remove other dangerous items (vehicles, knives…).
Misdirected! I-1491 ignores that 95-97% of violent crimes are
not related to mental illness. Deceptive! In Isla Vista, the parents
told police they “found it difficult to believe their son either
owned weapons or would actually hurt anyone.” Unintended
consequences! Confiscating firearms doesn’t make someone
stable, it makes them mad.

32 Initiative Measure No. 1501
The Secretary of State is not responsible

(WAC 434-381-180).
Initiative Measure No. 1501 concerns seniors and vulnerable individuals.
This measure would increase the penalties for criminal identity theft
and civil consumer fraud targeted at seniors or vulnerable individuals;
and exempt certain information of vulnerable individuals and in-home
caregivers from public disclosure.

Explanatory Statement
Written by the Office of the Attorney General
The Law as it Presently Exists
It is currently a crime in Washington to knowingly obtain,
possess, use, or transfer a means of identification or financial information of another person, living or dead, with
the intent to commit any crime. In other words, it is illegal
to have or use another person’s identity or financial information to commit a crime. This crime is known as identity
theft and is punishable as a class C felony. If, however, the
identity theft involves obtaining credit, money, goods, services, or anything else valued over $1,500, it is considered
a class B felony and is punishable with a longer maximum
prison sentence and higher potential fines.
A person who is a victim of consumer fraud may be able
to sue the wrongdoer in court to recover money or obtain
other relief. Several state laws authorize these types of
lawsuits and each law establishes the criteria for bringing a
lawsuit and the remedies available. For example, the Consumer Protection Act permits a person who is injured by
an unfair or deceptive action by a business to sue the business to stop the harm and recover damages caused by the
unfair or deceptive act.
The Public Records Act generally requires government
agencies to provide public records to anyone who asks for
them. However, some types of records may not be disclosed by government agencies. For example, there are
limitations on disclosure of certain types of financial information, including credit or debit card numbers and social
security numbers. Some types of personal information
may not be disclosed if the information would violate an
individual’s personal privacy. Disclosure of information violates personal privacy if it would be highly offensive to a
reasonable person and the information is not of concern to
the public. Generally, an individual’s name, telephone number, and address are not considered personal information.
The Effect of the Proposed Measure if Approved
This measure would change criminal and civil laws that apply when vulnerable individuals or seniors are targets of
identity theft or consumer fraud. The measure would define a “senior” as any person over the age of sixty-five. The
definition of “vulnerable individual” would include a person
(1) sixty years of age or older who cannot take care of himself or herself; (2) found by a court to be unable to take care
of himself or herself; or (3) receiving home care services.
The measure would increase the criminal penalty for identity theft when a senior or vulnerable individual, as defined,
is targeted. If a defendant were found guilty of knowingly
targeting a senior or vulnerable individual when committing
the crime of identity theft, the crime would be considered
identity theft in the first degree and be punishable as a
class B felony.
The measure would also increase civil penalties for consumer fraud that targets a senior or vulnerable individual,
as defined. Any person who commits consumer fraud that
targets such individuals would be subject to civil penalties
of three times the amount of the actual damages.
The measure would change the Public Records Act to
prohibit disclosing “sensitive personal information” of
both vulnerable individuals and “in-home caregivers of
vulnerable populations.” The measure defines “sensitive
personal information” to include names, addresses, GPS
coordinates, telephone numbers, email addresses, social
security numbers, driver’s license numbers, or other personally identifying information. It would apply to the sensitive personal information of care providers contracted by
the Department of Social and Health Services, home care
aides, and certain family childcare providers. The measure
provides specific circumstances when the government
may disclose such information. For example, the measure
would allow the information to be released to other government agencies or to a certified collective bargaining representative.
The measure also requires the Department of Social and
Health Services to report to the Governor and Attorney
General about any additional records that should be made
exempt from public disclosure to protect seniors and vulnerable individuals against fraud, identity theft, and other
forms of victimization.

Fiscal Impact Statement
Written by the Office of Financial Management
For more information visit www.ofm.wa.gov/ballot
Summary
Initiative 1501 would have no significant fiscal impact on
state or local governments.
General Assumptions
•	 The effective date of the initiative is December 8,
2016.
Assumptions for Expenditure Analysis
Increasing criminal penalties for identity theft
Initiative 1501 (I-1501) increases the criminal penalties for
the crime of identity theft to when the accused knowingly
targets a senior or vulnerable individual when knowingly
obtaining, possessing, using or transferring means of identification or financial information of another person with the
intent to commit, or aid or abet, any crime. No new expenditures have been identified.
Increasing civil penalties for consumer fraud
I-1501 increases civil penalties for consumer fraud targeting seniors or vulnerable individuals, as defined in the initiative. Any consumer fraud that targets a senior or vulnerable
individual would be subject to civil penalties of three times
the amount of actual damages. No new expenditures have
been identified.
Public records exemption
I-1501 provides a new exemption from public disclosure
laws for sensitive personal information of vulnerable individuals and their in-home caregivers, as defined in the
initiative. I-1501 would add the requirement that individual
names, addresses, GPS coordinates, telephone numbers,
email addresses, social security numbers, driver’s license
numbers and other personally identifying information be
protected, and thus be redacted before disclosure. These
additional redactions would result in little change to workload in responding to public records requests. It is assumed
the initiative would not result in a significant increase or decrease in the number of public records requests. Minimal
fiscal impact to the state or local governments is anticipated as a result of the new exemption.
Department of Social and Health Services report
I-1501 would require the Department of Social and Health
Services (DSHS) to report to the Governor and the Attorney
General “about any additional records that should be made
exempt from public disclosure to provide greater protection
to seniors and vulnerable individuals against fraud, identity
theft, and other forms of victimization.” Reporting would
be required within 180 days of the effective date of the
initiative. DSHS assumes the cost of reporting will be
minimal and can be absorbed with current resources.
State agency prohibition on release of sensitive
personal information
Subject to outlined exceptions, I-1501 would prohibit state
agencies from releasing sensitive personal information, as
defined in the initiative, of vulnerable individuals or their
in-home caregivers. This prohibition is expected to have a
minimal fiscal impact to the state as the additional redactions required under the initiative will result in an insignificant change to workload in responding to public records
requests.

Argument for Argument against
Consumer Fraud and Identity Theft Hurt Us All
You have heard the news and stories from family and friends
targeted in scams. They often start with a telemarketer
impersonating the IRS or a relative in distress, demanding
money or personal information. With basic information,
criminals can steal an identity, causing emotional stress,
devastating personal finances and ruining credit. Fraud
and identity theft hurt all of us and cause real financial and
emotional damage.
We Need to Protect Seniors and Other Vulnerable People
According to a recent study, over half of scam victims are over
age 50. In fact, financial exploitation of seniors costs them
$2.9 billion every year. For every case that is reported, it is
estimated that 43 others are not.
As caregivers, advocates for seniors and retired people,
and a public safety official, our priority is the health, safety
and protection of our state’s most vulnerable populations.
We cannot let fraudulent telemarketers and other criminals
continue to prey on them. We need the protections offered by
I-1501 for their peace of mind and safety.
Increase Penalties and Prevent Release of Personal
Information
I-1501 increases penalties on criminals who prey on senior
citizens and other vulnerable people. It prevents the
government from releasing information that could help identity
thieves targeting seniors and the vulnerable. And it protects
the personal information of caregivers.
Initiative 1501 is endorsed by consumer advocates, caregivers, law enforcement and public safety officials, and other
community leaders. Please join us in approving Initiative 1501.
Rebuttal of argument against
Senior citizens, vulnerable people, and their caregivers are not
special interests. When they are the victims of fraud or identity
theft, they deserve justice in the form of increased penalties
on the perpetrators of their crimes. I-1501 will discourage
fraudulent telemarketers and scam artists from profiting on
our personal information and increase penalties when they do.
I-1501 is supported by the Washington State Senior Citizens’
Lobby because they recognize we all need its protections.

Please vote no. Initiative 1501 isn’t what it claims to be. It was
given an innocent-sounding title to deceive voters as to its
true purpose. Initiative 1501 is an attack on vulnerable individuals by a powerful special interest that has poured over $1.2
million into funding it.
Initiative 1501 was written by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). Its goal is to rewrite the Public Records
Act to prevent in-home caregivers and childcare providers
from learning they no longer can be forced to pay dues to the
union.
Through Initiative 1501, SEIU ensures that it, and only it, will
still receive caregivers’ information — even Social Security
numbers — so it can continue capturing over $20 million in
dues from these individuals every year. Caregivers have the
right to stop paying SEIU, but the State isn’t informing them
of their right. If Initiative 1501 passes, caregivers will not even
be able to contact each other to discuss issues of common
concern.
Initiative 1501 is a shameless attempt by a powerful special
interest to diminish government transparency and the rights of
hard-working caregivers. Our strong government transparency
laws should not be weakened to oppress low wage workers.
Every person deserves to know his or her rights. Initiative 1501
empowers only the already-powerful.
Our Public Records Act, one of the best in the nation, shouldn’t
be manipulated for the enrichment of a wealthy special interest and for the purpose of keeping in-home caregivers and
childcare workers in the dark.
Rebuttal of argument for
Don’t be deceived. The only two caregivers who helped draft
the I-1501 pro statement are SEIU activists, not ordinary
workers. That’s because the measure only benefits union
executives, not hard-working caregivers. It has nothing to do
with protecting seniors from identity theft. It’s all about keeping
caregivers from discovering they no longer have to share their
paychecks with the union. Follow the money. I-1501 protects
union bosses’ wallets while hurting workers and vulnerable
individuals.

Explanatory Statement
Written by the Office of the Attorney General
The Law as it Presently Exists
The sales tax is imposed on retail sales of most articles
of personal property, digital products, and some services.
The current state sales tax rate is 6.5 percent, though some
local governments impose their own sales taxes that make
the rate paid by purchasers higher.
The state business and occupation tax is imposed on the
gross income of business activities conducted in Washington. The business and occupation tax rate varies by the
type of business or occupation. Most manufacturing businesses are taxed at a rate of 0.484 percent of their gross
income, but some manufacturers pay lower rates.
Burning fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas) produces carbon dioxide, which can trap heat in the Earth’s
atmosphere. There is no state tax on carbon dioxide emissions in Washington.
The Effect of the Proposed Measure if Approved
This measure would create a new tax and reduce certain
existing taxes. It would impose a new “carbon emission
tax” that applies to the sale or use of certain fossil fuels and
electricity generated from fossil fuels. It also would reduce
the state sales tax rate, reduce the business and occupation tax rate on manufacturing, and fund a partial sales tax
exemption for low-income families.
New Carbon Emission Tax
A new carbon emission tax would start July 1, 2017. It
would apply when fossil fuels are burned in Washington.
The tax would be collected by the first person or company
in Washington who sells or burns the coal, oil, or other fossil
fuel. The measure includes provisions to avoid doubletaxing a fuel. For most fossil fuels, the tax rate would start
at $15 per metric ton of carbon dioxide emitted. Then, the
tax rate would rise to $25 per metric ton on July 1, 2018.
After that, it would increase by 3.5 percent plus inflation
each year until the tax rate reaches a maximum of $100
per metric ton, adjusted for inflation. The state Department
of Revenue would adopt rules for calculating the amount
of carbon dioxide emitted for each type of fuel and fuel
use and for paying the tax. The carbon emission tax would
apply to electricity producers, but only on the proportion
of electricity produced using fossil fuels. It would not apply
to electricity produced using hydroelectric dams, nuclear
power, wind, or solar power. Certain industries that obtain
electricity generated outside Washington also may be
required to pay the tax.
The carbon emission tax would be phased in more slowly
for some kinds of fuel used for specific purposes. These
fuels include certain fuels used solely for agricultural
purposes; fuel purchased for public transportation or by a
private nonprofit transportation provider; fuel purchased by
the Washington state ferry system for use in its ferries; and
fuel purchased for school buses. For these fuels, the initial
tax rate would be 5 percent of the tax rate imposed on
other fuels. On July 1, 2019, the tax rate would increase to
10 percent of the tax rate imposed on other fuels. The rate
would increase in 5 percent increments every two years
after that until July 1, 2055, when it would be the same as
the carbon emission tax rate imposed on other fuels.
Reductions in Existing Taxes
This measure also would reduce some taxes. On July 1,
2017, the state sales tax rate would be reduced from 6.5
percent to 6.0 percent. On July 1, 2018, it would be reduced again, to 5.5 percent. The state business and occupation tax rate for manufacturing would be reduced to
0.001 percent on July 1, 2017, from the current rate of
0.484 percent for most manufacturers.
Working Family Tax Exemption
Finally, the measure would expand and fund a working
family tax exemption. That exemption would allow lowincome taxpayers (those who qualify for the federal earned
income tax credit) to receive a refund for some of the state
sales taxes they paid during the year. In 2017, an eligible
applicant would receive 15 percent of the federal earned
income tax credit or $100, whichever is larger. Starting
in 2018, the refund amount would be 25 percent of the
federal earned income tax credit or $100, whichever is
larger.
Other Provisions
The state would adopt rules needed to implement the
measure. The measure also requires reports to the Governor and Legislature on how the measure is affecting state
revenues. The reports would be submitted every year from
2017 through 2027, and every two years after that.

Fiscal Impact Statement
Written by the Office of Financial Management
For more information visit www.ofm.wa.gov/ballot
Summary
During the first six fiscal years, state General Fund revenue
would decrease by a net amount of $797.2 million. This
results from implementing a new carbon tax, reducing the
state retail sales tax rate by 1 percentage point and reducing
certain manufacturing business and occupation taxes.
The Working Families Tax Exemption Program would be
funded. Sales tax revenue for the state Performance Audits
of Government Account would decrease by $8.9 million.
Local tax revenue would increase by $156.1 million. State
expenditures would increase by $37.4 million.
General assumptions
•	 The effective date of the initiative is July 1, 2017.
•	 Estimates use the state’s fiscal year of July 1 through
June 30. Fiscal year 2016 is July 1, 2015, to June 30,
2016.
•	 The provisions of the initiative apply prospectively,
not retroactively.
State revenue assumptions
•	 Revenue estimates are based on the February 2016
Economic and Revenue Forecast, Department of
Revenue tax return data and the Washington State
Department of Commerce, State Energy Office,
Carbon Tax Assessment Model (CTAM) – version
3.1c.
State revenue impacts
The initiative contains four provisions that affect state
revenue — increased revenues from a new carbon tax,
reduced state revenue from a 1 percentage point retail
sales tax rate reduction, reduced state revenues from a
business and occupation (B&O) tax reduction for certain
manufacturing taxpayers and decreased revenues from
expansion of the Working Families Tax Exemption Program.
Carbon tax
Estimates are based on the CTAM and the Global Insight
forecast for the consumer price index for all urban areas
(CPI-U), November 2015. The Department of Commerce
periodically updates data in the CTAM. Any data updates
to the CTAM made between preparation and publication
of this fiscal impact statement are not reflected in the
estimates displayed here.
Revenue assumptions:
•	 The carbon tax rate is equal to $15 per metric ton of
carbon dioxide as of July 1, 2017.
•	 The carbon tax rate is equal to $25 per metric ton
of carbon dioxide as of July 1, 2018, and increases
by 3.5 percent, plus the inflation rate, each year
thereafter.
•	 The inflation rate is equal to the CPI-U.
•	 The phased-in tax rates associated with several
fuel uses are not reflected in this analysis, although
lowering the carbon tax rate for the specific fuel uses
outlined in the bill would result in lower carbon tax
revenues.
•	 No carbon tax reductions or refunds are made for
long-term storage of carbon emissions (qualified
sequestration).
•	 No credits are granted for payment of a similar carbon
tax in another state.
•	 The following assumptions are made in the CTAM for
modeling purposes:
o Year One is set to calendar year 2017 to most
closely correspond to the July 1, 2017, effective
date of the proposed carbon tax.
o The baseline reference energy forecast (option A)
is specified in the CTAM.
o Industrial process emissions are not included.
o Jet fuels are not exempted.
o Marine fuels are not exempted.
o “Transition coal” is not exempted.
o The additional 11.9 cents of state gasoline/diesel
taxes that became law in 2015 are included
in the model as a supplemental fuel tax, as the
CTAM does not include this in its current baseline
assumptions.
The carbon tax increases revenues that are deposited
in the state General Fund. Table 1 provides estimates of
the carbon tax revenue during the next six fiscal years to
the state General Fund. Revenues deposited in the state
General Fund may be used for any government purpose
such as education; social, health and environmental
services; and other general government activities.
(See Table 1 on page 41)
Business and occupation tax
The state B&O tax is a gross receipts tax measured on the
value of products, gross proceeds of sales or gross income
of the business.
Revenue assumptions:
•	 The following B&O tax classifications are reduced to a
rate of 0.001 percent:
o Manufacturing
o Manufacturing Dairy/Biodiesel/Alcohol/Split
Peas/Fresh Fruit & Vegetables
Initiative Measure No. 732
Initiative Measure No. 732 39
o Slaughter-Breaking-Processing Perishable Meat
Wholesaling and Manufacturing
o Manufacturing Commercial Airplanes, Components & Aero Tooling
o Wholesaling Commercial Airplanes, Components
& Aero Tooling
o Retailing Commercial Airplanes, Components &
Aero Tooling
o Processing for Hire Timber Products
o Manufacturing of Timber Products
o Manufacturing of Semiconductors
•	 As a result of these tax rate changes, the multiple activities tax credit has been recalculated and factored
into this analysis.
•	 The growth rate mirrors the total B&O taxable activity forecast reflected in the Economic and Revenue
Forecast Council’s February 2016 forecast.
•	 All B&O tax rate changes are effective July 1, 2017,
and none of these changes is retroactive.

tax revenue for the next six fiscal years to the state General
Fund, rounded to the nearest $1,000.

The state retail sales tax rate decreases from 6.5 percent
to 6.0 percent on July 1, 2017, and from 6.0 percent to 5.5
percent on July 1, 2018. This change reduces revenues deposited in two funds: the state General Fund and the state
Performance Audits of Government Account.
In addition, changes in the state retail sales tax rate could
affect the amount of goods purchased, which would affect
state and local tax revenue. The Department of Revenue
prepared the revenue estimates assuming a price elasticity
of 1.01. Price elasticity is a method used to calculate the
change in consumption of a good when price increases or
decreases. Due to price elasticity, state B&O tax revenue
could increase with the change in the state retail sales tax
rate.
Table 3 provides estimates of the decrease in state retail
sales tax revenue for the next six fiscal years to the state
General Fund.
(See Table 3 on page 41)
Table 4 provides estimates of the decrease in state retail
sales tax revenue for the next six fiscal years to the state
Performance Audits of Government Account. This account is used by the Washington State Auditor to conduct
comprehensive performance audits required under RCW
43.09.470.
(See Table 4 on page 41)
Table 5 provides estimates of the increase in state B&O tax
revenue deposited in the state General Fund over the next
six fiscal years.
(See Table 5 on page 41)
Working Families Tax Exemption
Estimates are based on 2013 individual income tax returns
filed with the Internal Revenue Service. The initiative modifies the Working Families Tax Exemption Program, which is
an exemption in the form of a refund for eligible taxpayers.
Under current law, the exemption amount for a qualified
taxpayer for the prior federal tax year is the greater of 10
percent of the federal earned income tax credit (EITC) or
$50. The initiative increases that amount to the greater of
15 percent of the EITC or $100 for exemptions claimed in
2017, and the greater of 25 percent of the EITC or $100 for
exemptions claimed in 2018 and thereafter.
Revenue assumptions:
•	 Applications for calendar year 2016 would be received beginning July 1, 2017.
•	 Applications for calendar year 2017 would be received beginning Jan. 1, 2018.
•	 Calendar year 2016 and calendar year 2017 refunds
would both be paid during fiscal year 2018.
•	 The participation rate in the Working Families Tax Exemption Program is assumed at 90 percent in the first
year, 93 percent in the second year and 95 percent in
the third year and thereafter.
•	 The Working Families Tax Exemption is based on the
EITC from the prior year.
•	 The number of qualified applicants grows 3 percent
annually.
•	 All refunds are paid by June 30 of the year that the
Working Families Tax Exemption is claimed. However, applications for the first year cannot be submitted
until July 1, 2017. This estimate assumes refunds for
calendar year 2016 (requested in 2017) will be paid by
Dec. 31, 2017.
Table 6 provides estimates of the decrease in state General
Fund revenues due to the changes in the Working Families
Tax Exemption Program.
(See Table 6 on page 41)
Local government revenue
Due to price elasticity from the change in the state retail
sales tax rate, local retail sales tax revenue could increase.
Table 7 provides estimates of the increased local government revenues collected during the next six fiscal years.
(See Table 7 on page 41)
40 Initiative Measure No. 732
State expenditure assumptions
•	 Expenditures for staff salaries reflect a general wage
increase of 1.8 percent effective July 1, 2016, and
corresponding adjustments to benefits reflecting 30
percent of the salary adjustment.
•	 One full-time equivalent (FTE) employee equates to
2,080 hours of work for one calendar year.
State expenditures
To implement the initiative, the Department of Revenue will
incur expenditures of about $37.4 million and need additional FTEs during the first six fiscal years. Table 8 provides
cost estimates and FTEs by fiscal year. Expenditures are
rounded to the nearest $1,000.
(See Table 8 on page 41)
About 200,000 taxpayers are affected by changes in the
retail sales tax rate and about 12,000 taxpayers are affected by changes in manufacturing B&O tax rates. Costs for
implementing the B&O tax and retail sales tax changes include:
•	 Programming and testing computer system changes.
•	 Creating a special notice for affected taxpayers and
updating publications and web pages.
•	 Printing and mailing special notices to affected taxpayers who do not file electronically.
•	 Responding to questions from affected taxpayers.
About 1,500 taxpayers are affected by the carbon tax.
Costs for implementing the carbon tax include:
•	 Programming and testing computer system changes,
including new addenda for calculation of the carbon
tax and a new software application to submit fuel mix
reports.
•	 Creating new educational and informational materials for affected taxpayers in hard copy and electronic formats, including updates to these materials, as
needed.
•	 Responding to questions and assisting affected taxpayers with return preparation and other compliance
assistance.
•	 Technical advice for implementation, including procedures, forms, worksheets and guidance documents,
and development of the carbon calculation.
•	 Additional work with affected parties and coordinating implementation among several state agencies
during the startup process.
•	 Preparation of required reports to the governor and
Legislature.
•	 Adoption of two new administrative rules.
For the Working Families Tax Exemption, the initiative modifies several provisions affecting program administration by
the Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue
assumes 460,600 individuals will file a claim the first year
applications are accepted, beginning July 1, 2017. Costs
to operate the program will change if the number of claims
increases or decreases substantially.
The Department of Revenue is in the middle of its tax and
licensing system replacement project. The timing of the initiative means only a minimum level of functionality of the
new system is in place by July 1, 2017, to accept Working
Families Tax Exemption applications. Other costs for implementing the Working Families Tax Exemption provisions
of the initiative include:
•	 Programming (through contracting with third-party
programmers) to set up, test and verify the computer
systems to process refund applications for payment,
including an Internet-based application process, processing queues, tracking, imaging and electronic
funds transfers.
•	 Creating printed materials, Web information and media advertising.
•	 Designing and developing forms and other materials
to process exemption claims.
•	 Organizing a group to receive and process claims for
remittance.
•	 Responding to questions and assisting affected taxpayers.
•	 Preparing and training new staff to begin processing
applications July 1, 2017.
•	 Adopting one new administrative rule.
•	 Printing and mailing notices to those who would qualify for the Working Families Tax Exemption, based on
the best available information.
•	 Processing applications, including verification of
claims.
•	 Processing and sending refund checks to eligible
claimants.
•	 Collecting refunds processed in error or fraudulently
filed.

42 Initiative Measure No. 732
Argument for Argument against
Yes On I-732: Act Now for Clean Energy
Dirty fossil fuels pollute our air and water, threaten our forests,
harm our kids, and damage our climate. I-732 makes polluters
pay. It accelerates the shift to clean energy like solar, wind,
and hydropower. And it returns the money polluters pay to
everyone’s pocket by lowering other taxes.
Clean Air, Clean Water, Healthy Forests
Washington families and kids deserve a safe environment with
clean air and water and healthy forests. I-732 puts a price on
carbon pollution from fossil fuels like coal and oil, but not on
clean energy like solar and wind. It accelerates clean energy,
creating good, local jobs, while driving down the burning of
fossil fuels and the pollution, asthma, and smog they cause.
Fights Pollution and Climate Change
I-732 fights climate change by making big polluters pay. It’s an
effective, bipartisan policy similar to one that’s been working
successfully in British Columbia since 2008.
Makes Polluters Pay. Protects Working Families.
Our current tax system hits lower- and middle-income families
hardest. I-732 changes that. It uses the money polluters pay
to lower sales taxes, saving the average family hundreds
of dollars a year. And it sends tax refunds to hundreds of
thousands of working families. It makes Washington’s taxes
fairer as it makes our state cleaner.
Protecting our air, water, and climate just can’t wait. We
have a moral obligation to leave our kids a healthier, cleaner
Washington! Vote Yes on I-732.
Rebuttal of argument against
I-732 taxes polluters and uses that money to lower sales taxes
on working families. Our opponents’ main argument, based
on a disputed analysis, is that tax revenue over 6 years might
decline less than 1%. Our main argument is that droughts,
fires, and floods from climate change will definitely threaten
our environment, our economy, and our kids’ futures. I-732
reduces pollution and boosts clean energy with a proven,
bipartisan approach. Vote Yes!

State Deficit
I-732 will make Washington’s budget mess worse. A
Department of Revenue analysis found I-732 will cut funding
available for education, health care, and other vital services
by $797 million over the next six years. Our state faces a $5
billion deficit and court orders to meet basic education and
mental health needs. I-732 makes this situation worse.
Climate and Jobs
Climate policy must be comprehensive, so it doesn’t harm
people and kill jobs. I-732 fails this test. A clean-energy
economy can reduce carbon emissions and reverse climate
change while also creating family-wage jobs, rebuilding
crumbling infrastructure, investing in areas hardest hit by
pollution, and providing a “Just Transition” for workers and
communities. I-732 doesn’t do any of this.
Instead, I-732 imposes an accelerating carbon tax on
businesses, with no provisions for compliance flexibility or
energy-efficiency incentives. Some businesses will simply
move their jobs and pollution across state lines.
Equity
Vulnerable families in communities near pollution hot spots
and workers in energy intensive industries are hardest hit
by pollution. But I-732’s “Working Families Tax Exemption”
provides less than half of this population with any relief
from increased energy costs. These communities will need
investments and jobs to make an equitable transition to a
forward-thinking clean-energy economy. I-732 ignores this.
At a time when we are struggling to maintain good jobs and
fund basic services, I-732 would send Washington in the
wrong direction. Vote no.
Rebuttal of argument for
We need to get climate policy right. I-732 has too many
unintended consequences. I-732 gives tax breaks to polluters
without any accountability and fails to invest in clean air
and water, jobs and clean energy, or healthy forests and
communities. I-732 further strips our state budget, harming
education and infrastructure programs our communities need.
This accelerating carbon tax will only push jobs and businesses
elsewhere, and will not significantly address climate change.

Initiative Measure No. 735 concerns a proposed amendment to
the federal constitution.
This measure would urge the Washington state congressional
delegation to propose a federal constitutional amendment that
constitutional rights belong only to individuals, not corporations,
and constitutionally-protected free speech excludes the spending
of money.
Should this measure be enacted into law?

Explanatory Statement
Written by the Office of the Attorney General
The Law as it Presently Exists
The United States Supreme Court has held that the First
Amendment to the United States Constitution protects
the right of individuals to contribute money to candidates
running for office and to spend money independently to
support or oppose candidates. In 2010, the Court held in a
case called Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission,
558 U.S. 310 (2010), that the First Amendment also gives
corporations a right to independently spend money to
support or oppose candidates.
An amendment changing the United States Constitution
may be proposed either by the United States Congress or
by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of
the States’ legislatures. A proposed amendment becomes
a part of the Constitution if it is ratified by three-fourths of
the States. The amendment process is described in Article
V of the United States Constitution.
The Effect of the Proposed Measure if Approved
The measure would urge Washington’s current and future
members of Congress to propose a joint resolution to
amend the United States Constitution. The proposed
amendment would state that constitutional rights belong
only to individual human beings; that spending money is not
free speech under the First Amendment; that governments
are fully empowered to regulate political contributions and
expenditures to prevent undue influence on government;
and that political contributions and expenditures must be
promptly disclosed to the public.
The measure would urge Washington’s members of
Congress to choose an amendment ratification method
that will best ensure that the people are heard and
represented during the ratification process. It would also
urge current and future Washington legislatures to ratify
such an amendment when passed by the United States
Congress and delivered to the States for ratification.
Finally, the measure would provide that immediately after
the measure is enacted, the Washington Secretary of
State is directed to deliver copies of the measure to the
Washington State Governor, all current members of the
Washington State Legislature, all current members of the
United States Congress, and the President of the United
States.
Fiscal Impact Statement
Written by the Office of Financial Management
For more information visit www.ofm.wa.gov/ballot
Initiative Measure No. 735
Initiative 735 would have no significant fiscal impact on
state or local governments. The initiative requires the Secretary of State to immediately deliver copies of the initiative
when enacted to listed elected officials, which would cost
approximately $325.
Assumptions for Analysis of Initiative 735
The initiative is a request to Washington’s current and future congressional delegation to propose a joint resolution
for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution clarifying five
items:
1. Constitutional rights are rights only to human beings.
2. The judiciary may not equate spending money with
freedom of speech.
3. All political contributions and expenditures must be
disclosed prior to elections.
4. Governments may regulate political contributions
and expenditures to prevent undue influence.
5. This act does not limit the people’s rights under the
First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
When enacted, the Secretary of State is directed to immediately deliver copies of the initiative to the governor, all
current member of the state Legislature, all current members of the U.S. Congress and the president of the United
States, which totals approximately 684 people. Assuming
the initiative is delivered by first class postage at $.47 per
piece of mail, the cost to fulfill this provision is estimated
at $325.
Initiative Measure No. 735 45
Argument for Argument against
Big Money is Corrupting Our Political System
The 2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. FEC and
other cases have unleashed unlimited, anonymous campaign
dollars from mega-wealthy individuals, corporations, unions,
and other special interests. SuperPACs and interest groups
spent more than $1 billion on campaigns in 2012 – almost 3
times more than 2008! This year will be even worse.
Instead of representing the people who elected them, many
politicians spend their time courting big donors who expect
favors in return. Where does that leave the voice and concerns
of the average citizen?
Congress Will Only Act If We Demand It
Although 80% of Republicans and 83% of Democrats support
overturning Citizens United, Congress will not act on its own --
politicians profit from business as usual. But when we voters
put our voices on record, we hold Congress accountable for
inaction. Sixteen states and over 650 municipalities have
already passed measures like ours. By adding Washington to
the list, we will tell our elected representatives that we want
change now.
A New Constitutional Amendment
Initiative 735 calls on Congress to initiate a Constitutional
amendment overturning Citizens United and stipulating
that spending money is not protected political speech. The
amendment would ensure that contributions are regulated and
publicly disclosed. It would also clarify that only people have
Constitutional rights -- not corporations or special interest
groups.
This is about restoring the power of “We the People.” Let’s
send a clear message to the other Washington. Vote “yes” on
Initiative 735!
Rebuttal of argument against
Initiative 735 will not limit freedom of speech or freedom of
the press. It will keep moneyed special interests from having a
louder voice than “We the People.” We support Initiative 735
because we believe in freedom of speech for everyone, not
just Super PACs, corporations, and wealthy individuals who
monopolize the media with attack ads and misinformation.
Spending unlimited, secret campaign money is legalized
bribery. If you cherish free speech, vote “Yes” on 735!
Initiative 735 is a dangerous proposal to allow government
censorship. This would be the first Constitutional amendment
since prohibition to take rights away.
Silencing speech is undemocratic
Citizens should have as much opportunity to share and
receive information as possible. Silencing certain speakers
is counterproductive. Forbidding citizens from spending their
money spreading their beliefs is totalitarian, not democratic.
We can, we must, find solutions that expand, instead of taking
away, our rights. Vote no I-735.
Initiative 735 opens Pandora’s Box
Initiative 735 allows censorship of both profit and nonprofit
corporations. Government would be free to censor news,
books, movies, music, and your favorite charity. If a corporation
made it, government could censor it. Should we empower
congressional Republicans to censor corporations including
Planned Parenthood, Playboy, PETA and WashPIRG? Absolutely not. Should we empower congressional Democrats to
censor CareNet, Fox News, National Organization for Marriage
and the NRA? Absolutely not. Vote no I-735.
We need more speech, not less
To prohibit spending money on speech would severely hamper
public discourse. The Founders wisely protected freedom of
speech and press, even though the historic printing press
cost money. The best protection for diverse speech is keeping
centralized regulators like Congress from controlling the
marketplace of ideas. Vote no I-735.
We can require disclosures
The Citizens United ruling allows government to require
disclosure of political contributions. We can bolster disclosure
requirements without amending the Constitution. Vote no
I-735.
Rebuttal of argument for
“Amendment I. Congress shall make no law …. abridging the
freedom of speech, or of the press…..” I-735 seeks to destroy
freedom of speech by amending the Constitution. I-735 seeks
to censor corporations such as the Seattle Times, the Tacoma
News Tribune, the Spokane Spokesman-Review, Disney/ABC,
Comcast/NBC, Time Warner/CNN, CBS, the New York Times,
Planned Parenthood, the Sierra Club, Facebook, Twitter, Google
and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Vote No on I-735.

House Bill 2768 (HB 2768)
This bill authorizes the Health Benefit Exchange (HBE)
to charge carrier assessments and the Office of the
Insurance Commissioner to charge premium taxes on
Family Qualified Dental Plans (QDPs) for QDPs listed
on the HBE. The assessments are estimated to range
from $25 to $50 per member per month. Depending
on the actual premiums paid, the HBE assessment will
be set at a level needed to meet the HBE’s costs for
offering Family QDPs through the Exchange. Without
more certainty about the QDP premium amounts, the
carrier assessment and premium tax revenues cannot
be estimated; hence, the overall ten-year cost to fee
payers is indeterminate.

The legislature has proposed a constitutional amendment on
the deadline for completing state legislative and congressional
redistricting.
This amendment would require the state redistricting commission
to complete redistricting for state legislative and congressional
districts by November 15 of each year ending in a one, 46 days
earlier than currently required.
Should this constitutional amendment be:
[ ] Approved
[ ] Rejected

Senate Joint Resolution No. 8210
54 Senate Joint Resolution No. 8210
The Constitutional Provision as it Presently
Exists
Article II, section 43 of the Washington State Constitution
requires that a commission be established every ten years
to redistrict state legislative and congressional districts.
Redistricting means determining the geographic boundaries of state legislative and congressional districts for
election purposes. The commission must be established
in January of each year ending in a one. The commission
is required to approve a redistricting plan by no later than
January 1 of each year ending in a two. If the commission
does not approve a plan by January 1 of a year ending in
a two, the Washington Supreme Court must adopt a plan
by April 30 of that year. The Legislature may amend the redistricting plan by two-thirds vote within the first 30 days of
the first legislative session convened after the commission
submits its plan to the Legislature.
The Effect of the Proposed Amendment if
Approved
The amendment would require the state redistricting commission to approve a redistricting plan for state legislative
and congressional districts by November 15 of each year
ending in a one. This would, in effect, shorten the time for
the commission to complete a redistricting plan by 46 days
(for example, the commission would need to approve the
next redistricting plan by November 15, 2021, rather than
the current deadline of January 1, 2022). All other deadlines for redistricting would remain the same.

Argument for Argument against
Washington has one of the nation’s best redistricting
systems – SJR 8210 makes it better
Thirty years ago, Washington voters established a bipartisan
commission to redraw political boundaries every ten years
as the population grows and shifts. This system avoids
controversial, partisan redistricting and has become a model
followed by numerous states.
SJR 8210 acknowledges that digital technology now enables
the commission to work more efficiently. This simple yet
important change shortens a year-long process by six weeks,
offering benefits to voters and taxpayers alike.
Increased Public Input: SJR 8210 ensures new boundaries
are adopted before busy year-end holidays
The public plays a vital role in the drawing of legislative and
congressional districts. Yet the past three redistricting plans
were adopted during year-end holidays, limiting public feedback and input. SJR 8210 sets a final deadline of November
15, ensuring the plan is adopted when the public is better able
to provide feedback.
Good Government: SJR 8210 allows adequate time to
implement new boundaries, saves taxpayer dollars
The current January 1 deadline leaves county officials little
time to implement new boundaries before spring elections; a
November 15 deadline resolves this and closes the redistricting office many weeks sooner, saving taxpayers thousands of
dollars.
Common Sense: Overwhelming bipartisan support for SJR
8210
This common-sense reform passed the Legislature unanimously
this year. Please Vote Yes!

Except for the President and Vice President, all federal of cials elected in
Washington must be registered voters of the state. Only federal of ces have
age requirements above and beyond being a registered voter.
Federal Qualifications
& Responsibilities
President & Vice President
The President must be at least 35 years old and a
natural born U.S. citizen. Voters indirectly elect the
President through the Electoral College. The President
is elected to a four-year term and cannot serve more
than two elected terms.
The chief duty of the President is to ensure the laws of
the nation are faithfully executed. This duty is largely
performed through appointments for thousands of
federal positions, including secretaries of cabinet-level
agencies and federal judges (subject to con rmation
by the Senate). The President is the Commander-inChief of the U.S. Armed Forces, has the power to
sign and veto (reject) laws passed by Congress, and
makes treaties with foreign governments (with Senate
approval).
The Vice President serves as the presiding of cer of
the Senate. The Vice President becomes President if
the of ce is vacated.
Candidate statements are printed exactly
as submitted. The Offi ce of the Secretary
of State does not make corrections of any
kind or verify statements for truth or fact.
Congress
The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have
equal responsibility for declaring war, maintaining the
armed forces, assessing taxes, borrowing money,
minting currency, regulating commerce, and making
all laws and budgets necessary for the operation of
government.
U.S. Senator
Senators must be at least 30 years old and citizens
of the U.S. for at least nine years. Senators serve sixyear terms. The Senate has 100 members; two from
each state.
The Senate has several exclusive powers, including
consenting to treaties, con rming federal appointments made by the President, and trying federal
of cials impeached by the House of Representatives.
U.S. Representative
Representatives must be at least 25 years old
and citizens of the U.S. for at least seven years.
Representatives are not required to be registered
voters of their district, but must be registered voters
of the state. Representatives serve two-year terms.
The House of Representatives has 435 members, all
of whom are up for election in even-numbered years.
Each state has a different number of members based
on population. After the 2010 Census, Washington
was given a 10th Congressional District.

Statement
Our campaign is based on the notion that Americans are
stronger together. We’re stronger when everyone can
contribute to the economy and share in its growth. We’re
stronger when we work with each other – and with allies
around the world – to keep America secure. And we’re
stronger when we’re united, not divided; when we come
together to overcome the challenges we face.
If we win this November, in our first 100 days, we’ll make
the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World
War II. We’ll invest in infrastructure, manufacturing, and
small businesses. We’ll make America the clean energy
superpower of the 21st century to take on the threat of
climate change, and create jobs in the process. And we’ll
pay for our plans by making Wall Street, corporations, and
the super-wealthy pay their fair share in taxes.
We’ll make college debt-free for all and tuition-free for the
middle class, while helping millions of people with student
debt. We’ll crack down on companies that ship jobs
overseas, and we’ll reward companies that share profits
with their employees. We’ll create policies that help people
balance work and family. And we’ll bring opportunity to
communities that have been left out and left behind.
Beyond the economy, we’ll take on other urgent challenges—
from reforming our broken criminal justice and immigration
systems to ending the epidemic of gun violence to getting
unaccountable money out of politics.
Americans aren’t just electing a president; we’re also choosing
a Commander-in-Chief. We’ve laid out a comprehensive
strategy to keep America safe by defeating ISIS, standing
with our allies, and respecting those who serve our country.
We know that America’s best days are still ahead of us.
When Americans come together, there’s nothing we can’t
do. That’s what our campaign is all about.

workers fought to unify workers regardless of where they
came from

Kennedy walked picket lines with Machinists on strike at

Statement
For the working class, the greatest of all battles ahead is to
throw off the image of ourselves that we do not have the
capacity to organize and to learn, to transform ourselves
and all social and human relations as we fight to end
capitalist rule and establish workers power. The capitalists
fear what’s building up amongst working people to their
slow burning global depression.
To meet this challenge we have joined protests against
police brutality demanding cops who kill- from Alton Sterling
in Baton Rouge, to Philando Castile in Minnesota to cattle
rancher Jack Yantis in Council, Idaho to Robert Lavoy
Finicum in Oregon- be charged and jailed. We demand free
political prisoners from Puerto Rican independence fighter,
Oscar Lopez, to Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abu-Jamal. We
are part of the fight for a government funded public works
program at union scale wages, for $15 and a union; for free
and medical care for all; to guarantee women the right to
abortion. We demand an end to Washington’s colonial rule
of Puerto Rico.
We speak out against Washington’s imperialist military
wars- from Iraq to Afghanistan and Syria. We fight the
rulers’ efforts to use workers revulsion at Islamic State’s
terrorist acts to scapegoat Muslims. We speak out against
Jew-hatred which seeks to divert workers attention away
from the real enemy- the capitalist system.
The Cuban revolution sent volunteers to beat back apartheid
South Africa’s’ invasion of Angola and sent doctors to fight
Ebola. The revolution shows the solidarity achieved when
workers and farmers over throw the capitalist class and
end their dog eat dog system.
The capitalists rule through their Democratic and Republican
parties as well the Libertarian and Green parties. We need a
party of the working class. Our party is your party, join us.

Statement
I am a labor, community and anti-war activist. Born in
Albuquerque, N.M., my father was a letter carrier, my
mother, a Mexican immigrant and garment worker. I am a
union activist and elected delegate to the San Francisco
Labor Council.
Today, 62% of the U.S. population lives paycheck to
paycheck, while the super rich accrue obscene wealth.
When the capitalist bankers torched the economy the
federal government bailed them out with the trillions of
dollars of our money. Today, the criminal bankers are richer
than ever while millions have been plunged into poverty.
The capitalist system cannot be fixed. The multiple crises of
inequality, injustice, endless war, environmental destruction
and more can only be resolved by replacing profit-driven
capitalism with a system based on meeting people’s needs
– socialism. Socialism means the workers have economic
and political power; the economy is planned to benefit the
people and the planet.
My party’s10-point program begins: For the earth to live,
capitalism must end. A job or income, healthcare, education
from preschool through university, adequate food and
affordable housing--all should be Constitutional rights. We
call for shutting down all U.S. military bases around the
world and bringing all U.S. armed forces home; ending
U.S. aid to Israel and self-determination for the Palestinian
people; lifting the blockade on Cuba; independence for
Puerto Rico; ending racism and the epidemic of police
brutality and mass incarceration; freeing Leonard Peltier,
Mumia Abu Jamal, Oscar Lopez Rivera and all political
prisoners; honoring Native treaties; defending unions and
a $20/hr minimum wage; equal rights for women including
full reproductive rights; full equality for LGBTQ people;
full rights for all immigrants; nationalizing the banks and
corporations and using their vast stolen wealth to provide
for people’s needs; and jailing Wall St. criminals.

Statement
After a career in clinical medicine, I am now practicing
political medicine, running for President to help heal our ailing
nation. In this historic moment, people are standing up like
we haven’t seen for generations, calling for an America and
a world that works for us all. We face unprecedented crises
that need transformational solutions that put people, planet
and peace over profit. We must break the stranglehold of
billionaires and their parties that have thrown us under the
bus.
We the people have the power to end unemployment,
poverty, and rampant inequality; to liberate a generation
trapped in predatory student debt; create a welcoming path
to citizenship; and end racism in policing and beyond.
We can create a Green New Deal establishing 20 million
living wage jobs that provide 100% clean renewable energy
by 2030 - reviving the economy, halting climate change,
and making wars for oil obsolete. We can create an
improved Medicare for All system, public higher education
as a right, and save trillions ending corporate welfare,
catastrophic wars, and tax favors for the wealthy. We can
protect women’s rights, Indigenous and LGBT people, our

Officer, Viet Nam, 1971 – 1973. Founder of Mia’s Children
Foundation, which provides services to homeless gypsy

Statement
As President of the United States, Mr. Castle’s priority will
be to strictly adhere to the Constitution in any proposed
legislation or federal government policies, including the
ending of unconstitutional wars and unconstitutional foreign
aid. He will work to make sure that America’s veterans and
military personnel receive the care and support they need
for injuries and hardships they have incurred while serving
in the armed forces.
He will work to withdraw the United States from the United
Nations and restore American Sovereignty. He will also
work to end the Federal Reserve System and restore the
gold standard to strengthen the dollar, both home and
abroad.
He will work to withdraw the federal government from
international legislation such as Agenda 21 and begin the
process of handing control of their lives and property back
to the local people.
Another priority of a Castle presidency will be to work
towards the ending of abortion in America by vetoing any
funding for abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood,
as well as recommending to Congress (and working to
make it happen) that they remove all jurisdiction over such
matters from the Supreme Court.
Darrell Castle believes that “It is the nature of the State
to seek dominance over the population. Freedom will
not ultimately remain intact if we leave it unattended.
America needs forward thinking leaders. Self-hatred and
appeasement only foster more disrespect. We must find
a way to chart our own course in the world as free and
independent people.”

Gov. of New Mexico, 1995-2003
Other Professional Experience
Despite his two terms as Governor, Gary Johnson still
prefers to call himself an entrepreneur. To pay for college,
he started a door-to-door handyman business. Twenty
years later, the one-man-shop had grown into one of the
largest construction companies in New Mexico, with more
than 1,000 employees.
Education
B.S., University of New Mexico
Community Service
Governor Johnson has been and remains involved in a
range of volunteer activities and organizations both in
his home state of New Mexico and nationally. Areas of
particular interest involve drug policy reform and environmental stewardship.
Statement
Gary Johnson is no stranger to taking on partisan political
forces. He was elected Governor of New Mexico as a
Republican in an overwhelming Democratic state – and reelected to a second term by a wide margin despite being
challenged by a popular and well-known Democrat.
As a businessman, Gary Johnson ran for Governor with
no prior political resume other than his college political
science degree and a passion for helping people.
Gary Johnson has always believed that good public policy
should be based on a practical cost/benefit analysis, rather
than strict ideology.
Johnson is best known for resisting the temptation to solve
every problem with government spending and regulation,
having vetoed more than 750 bills during his time in office
— probably more than all other governors combined.
He also cut taxes 14 times while never raising them. He
balanced the state’s budget, and left New Mexico with a
billion-dollar surplus.
Yet, despite cutting taxes and the size of government,
he improved New Mexico schools, executed a major
infrastructure overhaul, and earned national accolades for
his leadership in handling the devastating Cerro Grande
Fire that swept across the state in 2000.
An avid skier, adventurer, ironman, and bicyclist, Gary
Johnson has scaled the highest peak on each of the seven
continents, including Mt. Everest.

Statement
Our country isn’t working for people the way it should be.
And most days, Congress does very little to confront the
challenges we face.
Despite the obstacles, I work hard to break through the
gridlock and dysfunction and move us toward a country and
state that works for all families, not just the wealthiest few.
I know you want a Senator committed to getting results.
That’s why, after the Tea Party shut down the government in
2013, I led bipartisan negotiations to reopen the government
and restore important investments in education, jobs, and
other local priorities. After I heard from parents and teachers
that No Child Left Behind wasn’t working for our students, I
wrote a bill to finally fix this broken law, help end the reliance
on overtesting, and put our students first. My bipartisan bill
was signed into law, and NCLB is finally ending.
I am running for reelection because there is so much more
Congress should be doing to help workers, veterans, families,
and the economy—and I want to keep up the fight and make
sure Washington state families have a strong voice at the
table who will stand up for their values and priorities.
I am running to keep fighting to create jobs and grow the
economy in a way that actually helps local families. Instead
of tax cuts for the rich, I think we should give tax cuts to
working families and invest in college affordability, student
loan debt reduction, affordable childcare, increasing
the minimum wage, helping veterans transition to the
workforce—and more. And I’m going to keep fighting back
against those who would hurt our workers, turn back the
clock on women’s health, and divide our country.
I ask for your vote to keep fighting for you and all Washington
state families.

Chris and Ann Vance are regular volunteers with Reach Out
Federal Way, a program to serve the homeless in South King
County. Chris coached youth sports for many years and is
the past President of the Auburn Youth Soccer Association.
Statement
I’m running for the Senate because, probably like you, I’m
fed up. I’m fed up with the gridlock in Congress and the
politicians in both parties who won’t tell the American people
the truth about the challenges we face.
The truth is, the gap between rich and poor is widening
because our economy is not producing enough good
middle class jobs. We are over $19 trillion in debt, and
Social Security and Medicare are on the road to insolvency.
There are solutions to these problems but Republicans and
Democrats refuse to compromise and work together.
To address our debt crisis I support a bipartisan plan that
includes limits on discretionary spending, structural changes
that will strengthen Social Security and Medicare, and progrowth tax reform. These steps would create jobs and
reduce our debt.
To keep the peace I will always vote to keep America’s
defenses strong. We must do whatever it takes to protect
our homeland from terrorism, and the United States must
lead the fight to destroy ISIS in Syria and Iraq and deny them
the territory they need to recruit and train followers. The Iran
nuclear deal was a dangerous and destabilizing mistake.
It’s time for a big change, and that will never happen as long
as we keep sending the same people to Washington, D.C.
year after year. I believe with new leadership we can bring
Republicans and Democrats together to solve America’s
problems. I would appreciate your vote.
Chris Vance and his wife, Ann, have been married for 28

Strong advocate for the military, veterans, farmers, small

Statement
When I was a teenager in Kettle Falls, I never imagined that
one day I would be in Congress, working for the people of
Eastern Washington. Nothing could be more fulfilling than
helping the people of our district – veterans who have served
our country, entrepreneurs creating jobs and world-class
products, farmers that feed the world, and the vulnerable
who need our assistance.
I am working across the aisle to expand Fairchild Air Force
Base, prevent and combat wildfires, and protect rural
health care. We have trimmed hundreds of billions in federal
spending, passed laws to protect citizens’ privacy, and
pushed for bipartisan solutions to the problems facing the
Department of Veterans Affairs.
Yet, I believe we need deep reforms to our federal government. The President is acting without Congressional authority
on everything from regulating waterways to changing immigration policy. And the courts are legislating from the bench.
We need to restore the balance of power in the Constitution.
The American people are frustrated when government
bureaucrats – in the IRS, EPA and just about every other
agency – are out of touch with the people they are supposed
to serve. We, the people, must be in charge.
I have proposed legislation that will restore meaningful oversight to federal agencies and hold bureaucrats accountable.
This is our Founding Fathers moment. We need to win back
a government of the people, by the people, for the people.
You inspire me to keep working hard. Every veteran, business owner, farmer, policeman and servicemember I meet
at home inspires me. We have a lot of work to do, but every
day I recommit to working smarter. With God’s grace, and
with help from my family, and all of you, I keep trying to build
a federal government deserving of our trust.

Statement
As a successful small business owner of 30 years, Joe
knows how to create family-wage jobs. Working as a union
laborer, now CEO of a multi-million-dollar corporation, he
has decades of business, environmental and leadership
experience. As CEO of his Tribe, Joe ushered in a $10 milliondollar economic turnaround by restructuring 13 businesses
and securing a multi-million-dollar sustainable revenue
stream, which has improved the lives of nearly 10,000
Tribal members. Joe cares deeply for the environment. His
2006 landmark lawsuit against Teck Cominco forced them
to stop polluting the Columbia River and Lake Roosevelt.
He will continue to fight to protect open spaces and water
tributaries for future generations. As a community leader,
Joe and his wife maintained a ‘safe house’ for the youth in
their community. They’ve coached, mentored and supported
children in their community for decades. He is running
for Congress because he believes women, minorities and
middle class Americans need a voice in Congress. He
supports a nationwide living wage and equal pay for women
in the workplace. He believes we must improve our economy
and create regional employment opportunities in agriculture
and industry, so that our community can grow urban and
rural jobs. Rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure
through sensible government investments will create a
strong middle class. Joe will fight to protect affordable, safe
health care benefits for all, including reproductive services
for women. He will promote investments in education
for youth from pre-K through college that will prepare our
children for the 21st century and make Eastern Washington
a magnet for new business opportunities. Joe will work to
strengthen Social Security, Medicare and Veteran’s Benefits
by eliminating corporate tax loopholes and he supports
removing big corporate money out of politics to level the
playing field.

Statement
Over the last three years I’ve worked hard as governor to
help build a stronger economy. We’ve created over 250,000
jobs, been recognized as the nation’s best economy by
Business Insider and seen the lowest unemployment rate
since 2008.
When tragedy struck, we reopened the Skagit River I-5
Bridge in 27 days. We worked with courageous people
devastated by the Oso slide, comforting victims and
rebuilding communities. We took action to assist those
impacted by wildfires in Central and Eastern Washington.
As a state we need to give our children access to a worldclass education in an economy that demands new skills -
I’m confident we can do this. Every child now has access
to all-day kindergarten, we have smaller class sizes in early
grades, and better paid and trained teachers. And we made
an unprecedented tuition cut at all public colleges and
universities across Washington.
We know we need big improvements in our transportation
system. That’s why I was adamant the legislature pass
a bipartisan package that creates 200,000 jobs, repairs
bridges, creates new lanes, expands bus service and opens
the door to expanding light rail. While it will not fix everything
overnight, it puts us on the right path while we address
bottlenecks and find practical solutions.
When it comes to basic Washington values, we will not
waiver. We’ll protect children from the ravages of carbon
pollution that cause asthma and climate change. We will
work for an economy that builds a stronger middle class
by raising the minimum wage, ensuring paid sick leave and
advancing policies that allow working families to thrive.
I’m proud of our progress. With your vote, I’m confident we
can harness our state’s unique innovative spirit, and build
a stronger economy and more prosperous future for every
Washingtonian.

Statement
I listen, and I’ve heard loud and clear what people want.
They want a government that cares about them. They want
a governor who is effective -- a unifier, not a career politician.
They want a governor who will scrutinize programs, fix
broken bureaucracies, respect our tax dollars. They want a
governor who will focus on children learning, traffic moving,
prisons working; on controlling taxes and protecting our
environment.
My background is in business. I built a company that operates
on both sides of the mountains, that helps Washington’s
farmers export their crops. I pull people together and fix
problems.
As an elected King Co/Seattle port commissioner, I cut taxes
without sacrificing services; helped transform government to
defend middle class jobs; focused on tourism, transportation,
reducing air and water pollution and restoring habitat. I was
recognized for taking on ‘crony capitalism’.
Here’s what I’ll do as your governor: 1. Give every kid an equal
chance to get ahead by funding and innovating schools.
2. Reinvent high school by including pre-apprenticeships
for those not college-bound. 3. Reduce traffic jams by
emphasizing capacity, better roads and efficient transit.
4. Rebuild the state budget from zero, reexamining every
agency, tax incentive and program. 5. Put a moratorium on
new regulations until current ones are justified or eliminated.
6. Preserve working farms and forests; restore salmon,
steelhead and orca populations.
My agenda isn’t ideological, it’s not partisan. It’s about us,
pulling together, so people can get good jobs here, afford
houses, raise families and retire here in this natural beauty
we all love and want to protect.
Imagine a governor who works with both Republicans and
Democrats, who makes government better, not bigger. It’s
time government listened. It’s time we pull together and start
getting stuff done. It’s time.

Thank you for the honor of serving as your Secretary of
State. I have continued the office’s nonpartisan legacy by
expanding registration and voting access, maintaining the
integrity of our elections, preserving our state’s rich heritage,
and making it easier for businesses and charities to register

more registered voters than at any time in state history.

secure our voter registration and election systems, increase
voter participation, and continue to increase accessibility to
the State Library and Archives. I will continue to advocate for
underserved people − military service members and those

Statement
Tina Podlodowski offers a proven 30-year track record of
elected and community leadership, and the technology and
management experience to get voters participating in our
democracy again. She’s currently working with auditors and
leaders in all 39 counties on improvements like postagepaid ballots, more ballot drop boxes, and automatic voter
registration.
A successful high-tech businesswoman, Tina is qualified
to champion neglected reforms to support Washington
businesses and safeguard our tax dollars. She will invest
responsibly in a voting system that works for everyone, not a
particular political party.
Washington used to be a leader in elections. But under the
current Secretary of State voter participation has declined to
a record low of 38%, with over one million eligible citizens
still unregistered. Like many partisan Republicans, the
incumbent has routinely opposed the Washington Voting
Rights Act and other voting innovations like Election Day
registration and pre-registration for 16 and 17 year olds. We
must do better.
Tina is the only candidate endorsed by the non-partisan
Women’s Political Caucus of Washington – and she is
supported by county auditors, community organizations,
and voters of all parties who agree with Tina: “Every voice
matters. Every vote counts.”

Statement
Duane Davidson is the Benton County Treasurer. He is endorsed by nearly every county treasurer in the state, including
both Democrats and Republicans. The most trusted leaders in our state have endorsed Duane: former Governor Dan
Evans, Secretary of State Kim Wyman and former Secretary
of State Sam Reed among others.
The incumbent state Treasurer has used his office to push
for a state income tax. Duane Davidson believes the State
Treasurer should be above partisan politics, he’ll never use
this office to promote an income tax or other agenda. He will
defend the interests of taxpayers and always keep the state
government accountable for how it invests our tax dollars.
No one is better qualified to serve as State Treasurer. Duane
leads the county treasurers’ association, his office has innovated nationally recognized efforts to save taxpayer money
and improve government openness and accountability. He’s
established an investment pool that manages hundreds of
millions of taxpayer dollars. There’s a big difference between
safeguarding taxpayer money and managing personal investments, Duane knows the difference.
Duane lives in the Tri-Cities. He’s active in the Gideons, Kiwanis, and his local church. He has three children, Bailey,
Luke, and Kinzey.

sector finance, investment and accounting experience.

Statement
You deserve honest and understandable management of
our State’s finances. For too long, the professional politicians elected Treasurer have helped put us $20 billion in
debt. Now Washington has the 6th highest state debt per
person in the nation.
This deficit spending is unacceptable. I will lead us in a different
direction.
I’m the only candidate with the high-level private industry
experience to bring much needed change to the Treasurer’s office. My professional finance background, and commitment to integrity and open government, have earned me
endorsements from former Attorney General Rob McKenna
and Independents, Democrats, and Republicans across our
state (see HireMichaelWaite.com).
As Treasurer, I will fight for you against the dangers of increasing our debt, or hurting our economy with a state income tax.
I will honestly present financial information to taxpayers and,
most importantly, prioritize efficiency, accountability and decreasing state debt. That way we can increase the money
available for schools, public safety, our social safety net, and
community infrastructure, instead of spending $2 billion every year on debt payments to Wall Street. I’ve thrived as a
finance professional by delivering for clients - now, let me
deliver for you. Please vote Michael Waite for Treasurer.

Statement
Our state needs a passionate, skilled State Auditor who will
hold all government agencies accountable to Washingtonians. As the only candidate who’s audited, reviewed, and
improved businesses, hospitals, government agencies, nonprofits, and colleges, I’m able to lead the embattled State
Auditor’s Office and get results on day one.
We’ve seen the terrible headlines of mismanaged and failing
government agencies--ineffective homelessness programs
that increase homelessness and crime, prisoners escaping
mental hospitals, state employees injured, prison inmates
released early, and a Transportation Department creating
gridlock on our roads. We can and must do better!
I’ve spent my life in both the public and private sector
championing efficient, effective and ethical government;
justice for the most vulnerable; and increasing public trust.
Every dollar government wastes means fewer resources in
the classroom or for those in need, and more pressure to
raise taxes. As State Auditor, I will use performance audits to
ensure all our governments become good stewards of your
tax dollars, achieve real results, and earn your trust!
We deserve the most efficient, effective, and ethical
government. We can’t afford to elect someone to this critical
office who has zero experience. Elect an accomplished
auditor—elect Mark Miloscia for State Auditor!

Statement
I am the only candidate for State Auditor with proven
executive leadership experience. I have always served the
public with honesty and integrity during my 25 years of local
government service. It’s why I was named the 2005 County
Auditor of the Year by the Secretary of State, and it’s why
I’ve been endorsed by many County Auditors on both sides
of the Cascades!
Trusted: I have an unmatched understanding of public
records and public money. It’s why I’ve been endorsed by
Chris Gregoire and Norm Dicks; County Executives Dow
Constantine, Ron Sims, and Bob Drewel; National Women’s
Political Caucus; AFSCME/WSCCCE Council 2; and many
other leaders listed on my website.
Tested: Restoring public confidence in the State Auditor’s
office won’t be an easy job. I served as County Auditor during
the 2004 gubernatorial recount, and I led the statewide effort
to restore public confidence in our elections system. I led
Pierce County through the Great Recession and stood up
against elected officials who abused the public’s trust.
Transparent: My office received the Key Award from the
Washington Coalition for Open Government for refreshing
recordkeeping for the digital age. Government must be
accountable to the public it serves.

Statement
In 1800, John Adams wrote, “There is nothing which I dread
so much as a division of the republic into two great parties,
each arranged under its leader, and concerting measures in
opposition to each other. This, in my humble apprehension,
is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our constitution.” History shows other founders including Alexander Hamilton, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson
shared Adam’s concern. Perilously, this wisdom has yet to
be integrated into our society.
I chose to run for Attorney General because the Office has
become politicized to the detriment of the people. Like our
founders, I believe collaborative problem solving requires
more than two parties. We suffer when we divide ourselves
into opposing parties and attempt to rule others by majority.
If elected, I will continue working to protect Washington
Citizens from those that would deprive us of life, liberty, or
property.
Thank you for strengthening our society by taking your time
and energy to discuss important issues with those around
you before you cast your vote. The process of discussion is
what bonds us together. The time to vote from your heart,
instead of according to party, is now.

Statement
Washington suffered catastrophic, record setting wildfire
seasons. Too many communities have been disrupted and
lives, homes, livestock, forests and wildlife were needlessly lost. Providing disaster relief in communities affected by
the Eastern WA fires, and Oso landslide, I realized my experience as a retired Naval Officer and incident command
instructor could serve the citizens of Washington State. We
need to empower our communities in preparedness, work
collaboratively to create an integrated strategy among jurisdictions, and use common sense deploying local resources
to reduce the risk of repeating the catastrophic fires of the
past.
Careful management of our state’s 3 million acres of trust
lands, and revenue that our forests, farms, and waters
provide for school construction is an important constitutional
mandate. More than half of DNR land is permanently
conserved for protecting endangered species, salmon
habitat and recreation. The remaining working forests must
provide a steady stream of revenue for our schools and
protect jobs in rural communities.
The Department of Natural Resources needs positive leadership. I will draw upon my years of executive leadership
of large, diverse organizations and lead DNR as a “servant
leader.” The staff of DNR and the citizens of Washington deserve the best.

How we manage and protect Washington’s public lands and

our water and food sources, and safeguard our timber, shellfish, and agricultural economies. Our next Commissioner
must be a conservation steward, partner for rural economies, and advocate for clean energy jobs.
I have a lifelong connection to Washington’s people and
places. My grandparents came to the Nisqually Valley in the
Great Depression to start a cattle farm, which remains in our
family today. For two decades I’ve worked with businesses
and communities large and small to protect landscapes and
local jobs, crafting lasting solutions.
With your vote, I’ll work to restore healthy forests— implementing wildfire prevention plans and ending dangerous
steep slope logging. I’ll promote clean energy jobs— implementing a renewable energy plan on public lands that creates
job growth, curbs carbon pollution, and reduces impacts on
vulnerable communities. I’ll protect our working farmlands
and forests from development pressures— enhancing opportunities for farmers, forestry, and recreation.

Statement
Every Washington child deserves a great education, regardless of where they live, their household income or the color

on both sides of the Cascades, an Assistant Superintendent
at OSPI, and an administrator in districts with high-poverty

in Olympia dedicated to helping students succeed, not a
political agenda. With your vote, I will apply my passion and

exist, and expand public school options and excellence
statewide.

Reykdal, and I’d like to earn your vote to be our State’s next
Superintendent of Schools. I’ve dedicated my 20 year career
as an educator and education finance executive to helping
students achieve their dreams. The next Superintendent
must be an education policy and budget leader to ensure
local control, effective results, and accountability of your tax
dollars!
We must do three things to ensure opportunity for all kids:
1) Equitably fund our schools! It’s time to build bipartisan
support for school funding while reducing our dependence
on exceedingly high local property taxes. A child’s education
should never depend on the wealth of their neighborhood;
2) Reduce excessive standardized testing so teachers have
time to engage students and support their individual needs; 3)
Return high quality career and technical education programs
to our schools. To improve graduation rates, students need
career pathways they are passionate about!
I will be the first Superintendent in 30 years to actually have
kids in public school during my service. I will work hard to
ensure that all kids, teachers, support staff, and parents
are fully supported in our schools. Thank you for your
consideration.

stand up to powerful industry interests as an advocate for

commissioner, Mike Kreidler saved consumers in our state
over $300 million in auto and homeowners’ insurance by

Statement
Paying too much for insurance? Do you want four more
years of the same 16-year policy direction that governs the
state agency that regulates insurance companies?
Washington’s health insurance rates are proposed to rise
another 19% next year. Richard Schrock, as Washington’s
next Insurance Commissioner, will fight unjustified premium
increases, hold down deductibles and limit co-pays.
In 2013, highly respected Seattle Children’s Hospital waged
a successful legal battle with the Insurance Commissioner’s Office and three major insurers. Children’s, the region’s
premier pediatric hospital, took legal action to get their insured child patients covered by Commissioner-approved
insurance plans that had excluded Children’s from service
provider networks. In 2014, newspapers reported that a
whistleblower compliant revealed scandalous conduct within the Office of the Insurance Commissioner involving “major
systemic problems”. Our state’s largest newspaper subsequently called for “major reforms” that have not happened.
Obviously, policy changes are long overdue to broaden
access to affordable coverage. If elected Commissioner,
Richard Schrock will institute reforms that prevent powerful
special interests from influencing agency decisions, vigorously enforce consumer protection laws, and mandate
expanding healthcare service- provider networks. Future
appeals of Commissioner decisions must be fairly and
transparently decided by independent, impartial judges.

Legal/Judicial Experience
Professor David DeWolf taught at Gonzaga Law School for
28 years.  Previously, he was an attorney at Lukins & Annis
and clerked for the Idaho Supreme Court.  The author of five
volumes of “The Washington Practice”, he is an expert in the
Constitution, contracts, and torts.
Other Professional Experience

Doctor, Yale Law School.
Community Service
Member of the Spokane Public Schools Human Growth
& Development Committee; Lector, Mary Queen Parish;
President of Artisan’s Ark, helping the developmentally
disabled find employment.
Statement
Professor David DeWolf is exactly the kind of person we
need on the Washington Supreme Court: an expert in
our state constitution and Washington’s leading authority
on contracts and tort law. His books have been cited by
Washington appellate courts over 100 times and are used
daily by lawyers and trial judges. This is why he is endorsed
by both Democrats and Republicans.
For 28 years, Professor DeWolf taught thousands of students
at Gonzaga Law School, instilling his love of the law and his
respect for the constitution. He is often asked to testify on
the constitution and the proper balance of power between
judges and our legislators.
The current crisis in the court proves we need a thoughtful
and reasonable scholar to add much-needed restraint to
a court that has become adversarial rather than respectful
toward other judges and our elected lawmakers. “Olympia
has more than enough politicians,” says DeWolf, “we need
judges who will do their job—no more and no less.”
David and his wife Priscilla live in Spokane – he’d be only the
second member of the court from Eastern Washington. They
have three grown children and four grandchildren.

issues.
Other Professional Experience

Seattle.
Community Service
Greg helped create the Sexual Assault Interagency Coalition, and “Protecting Our Children”, a group that educates
parents on the risks of sexual predators. He has coached
youth soccer and baseball.
Statement
Greg Zempel is a leader in law enforcement and local government – experience the people of Washington need on our
state Supreme Court. For more than twenty years, Zempel
has kept the people of Kittitas County safe as their County Prosecutor. He has the support of Judges, Prosecutors,
state legislators and both Democrats and Republicans to
become our next Supreme Court Justice.
We all know our state Supreme Court has become too political. Law enforcement knows that the court is also too unpredictable, often changing the rules that prosecutors rely on
to fairly and effectively fight crime. Zempel promises a court
that is “less political, more predictable.”
The court has no one with major criminal prosecution experience – a serious omission because criminal law makes
up a majority of the court’s cases. Adding a prosecutor to
the court will make our state safer. The court has only one
member from eastern Washington, and no one with county
government experience. Electing Greg Zempel to the court
will add much needed diversity to a court that simply doesn’t
reflect our state.
Greg and his wife Dawn have four children. The family enjoys
hiking and many other outdoor activities.

A champion for judicial access, Justice Wiggins has worked

restraint. As a former school board president, Larson has
a unique insight into the major issues currently before the

Statement
It has been said that ‘Justice is what love looks like in
public.’ I would only add that sometimes that love is
tough. My campaign can be summed up in the concept of
restorative justice. Sometimes called “Reparative Justice,”
it means focusing on the needs of the victim, offender, and
community, instead of just punishment--thereby achieving
more victim satisfaction and offender accountability.
If elected, the velvet glove will hold an iron fist when needed.
However, I will work toward a better balance in caseload
priorities to conserve court resources; punishment that fits
the crime; partnership with court officers and local leaders
to create more comprehensive and cost-effective preventive
policy toward non-violent drug crimes. My court will not have
a revolving door. I will take more intuitive and compassionate
approaches to family law, child welfare and dependency
(CPS) cases with an eye to fewer broken families.
When interacting with our courts, you deserve to be treated
with dignity and fairness, by a judge with humility, who holds
principles of justice over that which is politically popular. If
you are ready for more than justice as usual, I’m asking for
your vote.
Thanks for reading!

Wes
McCart
(Prefers Republican Party)
Unopposed
It has been an honor to serve as your County
Commissioner since 2012. I am a 23 year resident of
Stevens County, a businessman and farmer. I recognize
the need to continue to expand our economic base,
grow our local economy, protect private property rights,
and get government bureaucrats and unnecessary
regulations out of the way.
I’ve led a healthcare roundtable to enhance local
medical services by not duplicating government paid
services and filling gaps in service, including the
advancement of our future mental health evaluation
and treatment facility and the retention of a local
developmentally disabled jobs program.
I have worked hard to maintain a balanced budget
with a modest reserve to cover unforeseen disasters
such as our fires and windstorms, while providing
continued customer services. This includes
implementing proper checks and balances.
I have worked to coordinate with state and federal
agencies on wildlife conflicts, water quality, forest
lands, exempt well provisions, local input into the
renegotiation of the Columbia River Treaty and many
other issues.
I pledge to continue to uphold high standards of
excellence, efficient management principles and
limited government and to continue to fight for your
rights.
I ask for your continued support and vote.

(Prefers Republican Party)
Commissioner District No. 3 | 4-year term
Too many times voting in Stevens County as a
Democrat, you look down the ballot and you have
no candidates. In the last 30 years that I’ve lived
in Northport, I’ve seen our local politics go further
and further to the right. There are too many issues
that affect our everyday life we just can’t continue
to ignore. Our current crop of commissioners is
considering shutting down Tri County Health, and
then where do we go? There has also been a local
push by our commissioners to take back federal
land. Nearly everyone in the county will be impacted
by these plans. It’s time to stand up to radical plans
that will not only change our way of life, but go a
long way to take away the things that make living
here the special place that Stevens County is.
Please vote and when you do consider a Democrat.

It has been my honor and privilege to serve as
your county commissioner these past three and
½ years. During this time I have worked diligently
to bring improvements to county governance
through budget reforms to bring stability and
security in county finances. I have adamantly
resisted unnecessary growth in government size
to keep costs down. I have encouraged efficiency
in county departments to better serve you, our
constituents and our employer.
Throughout the county I have worked consistently
to resist burdensome regulations that would
increase costs or restrict opportunities for our
people. In doing so I have spent countless hours
meeting with state and federal agencies to make
our county desire heard. The greatest desire is for
less regulation and more LIBERTY!
I have not served a trouble free first term and have
made mistakes in the way I have carried out my
tasks. I commit to improve in every way that I am
able in order to better serve you, my constituents.
However I have never wavered in my two great
goals. To work to Bring Government Back Home
and to never vote for a new or increased tax. I
would be humbled and honored to serve you
another 4 years.

amended to read as follows:
(1) Whereas the establishment of a minimum wage for employees is a subject of vital and imminent concern to the
people of this state and requires appropriate action by the
legislature to establish minimum standards of employment
within the state of Washington, therefore the legislature declares that in its considered judgment the health, safety and
the general welfare of the citizens of this state require the enactment of this measure, and exercising its police power, the
legislature endeavors by this chapter to establish a minimum
wage for employees of this state to encourage employment
opportunities within the state. The provisions of this chapter are enacted in the exercise of the police power of the
state for the purpose of protecting the immediate and future
health, safety and welfare of the people of this state.
(2) Since the enactment of Washington’s original minimum
wage act, the legislature and the people have repeatedly
amended this chapter to establish and enforce modern fair
labor standards, including periodically updating the minimum wage and establishing the forty-hour workweek and
the right to overtime pay.
(3) The people hereby amend this chapter to conform to
modern fair labor standards by establishing a fair minimum
wage and the right to paid sick leave to protect public health
and allow workers to care for the health of themselves and
their families.

PART II
ESTABLISHING FAIR LABOR STANDARDS BY
REQUIRING EMPLOYERS TO
PROVIDE PAID SICK LEAVE TO EMPLOYEES
NEW SECTION. Sec. 4. The demands of the workplace
and of families need to be balanced to promote public health,
family stability, and economic security. It is in the public interest to provide reasonable paid sick leave for employees
to care for the health of themselves and their families. Such
paid sick leave shall be provided at the greater of the newly increased minimum wage or the employee’s regular and
normal wage.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 5. (1) Beginning January 1, 2018, every employer shall provide each of its employees paid sick
leave as follows:
(a) An employee shall accrue at least one hour of paid sick
leave for every forty hours worked as an employee. An employer may provide paid sick leave in advance of accrual
provided that such front-loading meets or exceeds the requirements of this section for accrual, use, and carryover of
paid sick leave.
(b) An employee is authorized to use paid sick leave for the
following reasons:
(i) An absence resulting from an employee’s mental or
physical illness, injury, or health condition; to accommodate
the employee’s need for medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; or an employee’s need for preventive medical care;
(ii) To allow the employee to provide care for a family member with a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; care of a family member who needs medical diagnosis,
care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or
health condition; or care for a family member who needs
preventive medical care; and
(iii) When the employee’s place of business has been
closed by order of a public official for any health-related reason, or when an employee’s child’s school or place of care
has been closed for such a reason.
(c) An employee is authorized to use paid sick leave for
absences that qualify for leave under the domestic violence
leave act, chapter 49.76 RCW.
(d) An employee is entitled to use accrued paid sick leave
beginning on the ninetieth calendar day after the commencement of his or her employment.
(e) Employers are not prevented from providing more generous paid sick leave policies or permitting use of paid sick
leave for additional purposes.
(f) An employer may require employees to give reasonable
notice of an absence from work, so long as such notice does
not interfere with an employee’s lawful use of paid sick leave.
(g) For absences exceeding three days, an employer may
require verification that an employee’s use of paid sick leave
is for an authorized purpose. If an employer requires verification, verification must be provided to the employer within
a reasonable time period during or after the leave. An employer’s requirements for verification may not result in an
unreasonable burden or expense on the employee and may
not exceed privacy or verification requirements otherwise
established by law.
(h) An employer may not require, as a condition of an employee taking paid sick leave, that the employee search for
or find a replacement worker to cover the hours during which
the employee is on paid sick leave.
(i) For each hour of paid sick leave used, an employee shall
be paid the greater of the minimum hourly wage rate established in this chapter or his or her normal hourly compensation. The employer is responsible for providing regular notification to employees about the amount of paid sick leave
available to the employee.
(j) Unused paid sick leave carries over to the following
year, except that an employer is not required to allow an employee to carry over paid sick leave in excess of forty hours.
(k) This section does not require an employer to provide
financial or other reimbursement for accrued and unused
paid sick leave to any employee upon the employee’s termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation from
employment. When there is a separation from employment
and the employee is rehired within twelve months of separation by the same employer, whether at the same or a different business location of the employer, previously accrued
unused paid sick leave shall be reinstated and the previous
period of employment shall be counted for purposes of determining the employee’s eligibility to use paid sick leave under subsection (1)(d) of this section.
(2) For purposes of this section, “family member” means
any of the following:
(a) A child, including a biological, adopted, or foster child,
stepchild, or a child to whom the employee stands in loco
parentis, is a legal guardian, or is a de facto parent, regardless of age or dependency status;
(b) A biological, adoptive, de facto, or foster parent, stepparent, or legal guardian of an employee or the employee’s
spouse or registered domestic partner, or a person who
stood in loco parentis when the employee was a minor child;
(c) A spouse;
(d) A registered domestic partner;
(e) A grandparent;
(f) A grandchild; or
(g) A sibling.
(3) An employer may not adopt or enforce any policy that
counts the use of paid sick leave time as an absence that
may lead to or result in discipline against the employee. 
Initiative Measure No. 1433 101
(4) An employer may not discriminate or retaliate against
an employee for his or her exercise of any rights under this
chapter including the use of paid sick leave.
PART III

existing rights and remedies available under state or local
law for enforcement of the minimum wage shall be applicable to enforce all of the rights established under this act.

affected for the full amount ((of such wage rate)) due to such
employee under this chapter, less any amount actually paid
to such employee by the employer, and for costs and such
reasonable attorney’s fees as may be allowed by the court.
Any agreement between such employee and the employer ((to work for)) allowing the employee to receive less than
((such wage rate)) what is due under this chapter shall be no
defense to such action.
(2) At the written request of any employee paid less than
the ((wages)) amounts to which he or she is entitled under or
by virtue of this chapter, the director may take an assignment
under this chapter or as provided in RCW 49.48.040 of such
((wage)) claim in trust for the assigning employee and may

or her authorized representatives in the performance of his
or her duties in the enforcement of this chapter, or refuses
to admit the director or his or her authorized representatives
to any place of employment, or fails to make, keep, and preserve any records as required under the provisions of this

she has not been paid wages in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, or that the employer has violated any
provision of this chapter, or because such employee has
caused to be instituted or is about to cause to be instituted
any proceeding under or related to this chapter, or because
such employee has testified or is about to testify in any such
proceeding shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and
shall, upon conviction therefor, be guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
Sec. 9. RCW 49.46.120 and 1961 ex.s. c 18 s 4 are each
amended to read as follows:

Initiative Measure No. 1464
AN ACT Relating to accountability of Washington’s system
of electoral politics to the people; amending RCW 42.17A.400,
42.17A.430, 42.17A.445, 42.17A.645, 42.17A.470,
42.17A.050, 42.17A.750, 42.17A.755, 42.17A.765, and
42.17A.125; adding new sections to chapter 42.17A RCW;
adding a new section to chapter 82.32 RCW; creating new
sections; repealing RCW 82.08.0273 and 42.17A.550; prescribing penalties; and making appropriations.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF
WASHINGTON:
NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. This act may be known and cited
as the Washington government accountability act.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 2. (1) The people find and declare
that accountability to the people is of the utmost importance
in Washington’s system of electoral politics. Today, that system is tainted with a perception of corruption, insufficient
participation by citizens (who believe they have an insignificant role to play in our democracy), inadequate disclosure
of relevant information to the public on political advertising
and paid lobbying, and inadequate enforcement of the laws
intended to address these concerns.
(2) The Washington government accountability act is intended to increase accountability to the public in Washington’s system of electoral politics by:
(a) Preventing corruption and the perception of corruption in government by strengthening campaign contribution limits, establishing additional restrictions on campaign
financing, and prohibiting certain government officials and
employees from receiving compensation to lobby state government;
(b) Promoting citizen participation and open political discussion by establishing an effective system for citizen financing of election campaigns;
(c) Better informing the electorate by improving public
disclosure of information related to political advertising and
lobbying; and
(d) Improving enforcement of the laws governing electoral
politics by facilitating the reporting of violations, expanding
enforcement authority, providing resources for enforcement
efforts, and increasing potential penalties for violators.
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS AND
OTHER RESTRICTIONS
Sec. 3. RCW 42.17A.400 and 2010 c 204 s 601 are each
amended to read as follows:
(1) The people of the state of Washington find and declare
that:
(a) The financial strength of certain individuals or organizations should not permit them to exercise ((a disproportionate
or)) controlling or otherwise improper influence on the election of candidates.
(b) Rapidly increasing political campaign costs have led
many candidates to raise larger percentages of money from
or in coordination with special interests with a specific financial stake in matters before state government. This has
caused the public perception that decisions of elected officials are being improperly influenced by monetary contributions, including coordinated expenditures.
(((c) Candidates are raising less money in small contributions from individuals and more money from special interests. This has created the public perception that individuals
have an insignificant role to play in the political process.))
(2) By limiting campaign contributions, the people intend
to:
(a) Ensure that individuals and interest groups have a fair
((and equal)) opportunity to influence elective and governmental processes;
(b) Reduce the ((influence of large organizational contributors)) perception of corruption; and
(c) ((Restore)) Strengthen public trust in governmental institutions and the electoral process.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 4. (1) A public contractor or prospective public contractor, an entity such a contractor owns or in
which such a contractor has a controlling interest, a person
who owns or has a controlling interest in such a contractor if
the contractor is not an individual, or a director or equivalent,
officer or equivalent, or immediate family member of such a
contractor may not:
(a) Contribute more than one hundred dollars per election
to a candidate for an office having a decision-making role
in the negotiation, awarding, execution, performance, or
enforcement of the contractor’s qualifying contract or contracts;
(b) Deliver or transmit a contribution to such a candidate
from another person;
(c) Solicit contributions for such a candidate in amounts
exceeding one hundred dollars individually or five hundred
dollars in the aggregate for each election;
(d) Solicit contributions for such a candidate from the contractor’s employees, subcontractors, clients, or close family
members; or
(e) Engage in a private business transaction or private
business relationship with such a candidate or an entity in
which such a candidate has a substantial financial interest,
unless it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the business transaction or relationship is not part of any design to
gain or maintain influence over the candidate.
(2) A person registered or required to be registered as a
lobbyist, an entity such a lobbyist owns or in which such a
lobbyist has a controlling interest, a person who owns or has
a controlling interest in such a lobbyist if the lobbyist is not
an individual, or a director or equivalent, officer or equivalent,
or immediate family member of such a lobbyist may not:
(a) Contribute more than one hundred dollars per election
to a candidate for an office having a decision-making role
on any legislation, rule, standard, rate, or other enactment,
whether actual or potential, about which the person lobbied
in the past four years;
(b) Deliver or transmit a contribution to such a candidate
from another person;
(c) Solicit contributions for such a candidate in amounts 
Initiative Measure No. 1464 103
exceeding one hundred dollars individually or five hundred

(d) Solicit contributions for such a candidate from the lobbyist’s employees, clients, or close family members; or
(e) Engage in a private business transaction or private
business relationship with such a candidate or an entity in
which such a candidate has a substantial financial interest,
unless it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the business transaction or relationship is not part of any design to
gain or maintain influence over the candidate.
(3) For purposes of this section, an employee’s involvement with the making or directing of contributions from his
or her employer, or from a separate segregated fund or political committee established and maintained by the employee’s employer, if part of the employee’s normal duties, does
not qualify as transmittal or solicitation by the employee.
(4) A person may not solicit or accept contributions if the
person knows or has reason to know that the contributions
exceed the limitations provided in this section.
(5) For purposes of this section:
(a) “Close family member” of an individual means:
(i) The individual’s immediate family, as defined in this
chapter;
(ii) The individual’s spouse, domestic partner, child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, brother,
half brother, sister, or half sister;
(iii) A child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent,
grandparent, brother, half brother, sister, or half sister of the
individual’s spouse or domestic partner; or
(iv) The spouse or domestic partner of any person described in (a)(ii) or (iii) of this subsection (5).
(b) “Prospective public contractor” means a person who,
directly or as a subcontractor, has a pending application or
has manifested a specific intent to apply for or otherwise
seek out a contract or contracts that will be governed by
Title 39 RCW and will include the payment of public funds
from a government entity of at least one hundred thousand
dollars in the aggregate to any and all counterparties. This
definition does not include the employees of such a person
or, if the person is a union, the members of that union.
(c) “Public contractor” means a person who, during the
current election cycle for the relevant public office, directly
or as a subcontractor, has had a contractual relationship or
contractual relationships governed by Title 39 RCW, involving the payment of public funds from a government entity of
at least one hundred thousand dollars in the aggregate to
any and all counterparties. This definition does not include
the employees of such a person or, if the person is a union,
the members of that union.
(6) The commission is authorized to adopt rules, as needed, to enforce and prevent circumvention of this section.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 5. (1) An expenditure in support
of a candidate or opposing a candidate’s opponent, other
than an expenditure for the purposes described in RCW
42.17A.005(13)(b), is presumed to be made in coordination with that candidate or the candidate’s agent (whether
the candidate’s authorized political committee, a registered
person who directs the candidate’s or committee’s expenditures, or their agents), and is thus presumed to be a contribution as defined in this chapter, under any one of the following circumstances occurring after the effective date of
this section:
(a) The candidate or agent had specific previous knowledge of the expenditure;
(b) The person making the expenditure is an immediate
family member, partner, or employee of the candidate;
(c) The expenditure was made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, an
immediate family member, partner, or employee of the candidate; or
(d) Within two years prior to the expenditure being made
and within the same election cycle:
(i) The candidate or agent, and the person making the expenditure, attended a meeting at which campaign-related
strategy or planning related to the candidate’s election was
discussed;
(ii) The candidate or agent contributed to a political committee making the expenditure, the candidate or agent solicited one or more third parties to make contributions to a political committee making the expenditure, or the candidate
or agent solicited contributions at an event organized by or
hosted by a political committee making the expenditure;
(iii) The candidate or agent, and the person making the
expenditure, shared office space; or
(iv) The candidate or agent, and the person making the expenditure, had the same agent or coordinated with the same
person for nonministerial campaign-related purposes.
(2) Any presumption established under this section is rebuttable. If an alleged violation of this chapter is premised on
a presumption of coordination under this section, once the
basis for the presumption has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence in light of all the evidence presented
by all parties, the burden of proof is then on the presumptive
violator to disprove the presumed coordination by a preponderance of the evidence, again taking into account all the
evidence presented by all parties.
(3) Notwithstanding any provisions of this section, and regardless of whether a presumption has been established,
any relevant documents or supporting facts may be used to
demonstrate coordination of an expenditure.
(4) By September 1, 2017, and on an ongoing basis, the
commission shall publish guidance on best practices that, if
followed, will effectively rebut a presumption of coordination,
including through the documentation of an effective firewall,
and any alternative screening procedures the commission
deems sufficient. A presumptive violator may rebut a presumption established under this section by presenting a prima facie case that the commission’s then-current guidance
was followed. In order to resurrect the presumption, the burden of proof is then on the commission, attorney general,
or prosecuting attorney to prove by a preponderance of the
evidence, taking into account all the evidence presented by
all parties, that the commission’s then-current guidance was
not followed. 
104 Initiative Measure No. 1464
(5) This section does not apply in a citizen action under
RCW 42.17A.755(4). In such an action, a presumption of
coordination under this section may not be used to demonstrate a violation.
(6) The commission is authorized to adopt rules, as needed, to enforce and prevent circumvention of this section.
Sec. 6. RCW 42.17A.430 and 2010 c 204 s 606 are each
amended to read as follows:
All of the ((The)) surplus funds of a candidate or a candidate’s authorized committee ((may only)) must be promptly disposed of as provided in this section. If the candidate
received public funds from the democracy credit program
established under section 9 of this act, then the candidate
must transfer to the commission a certain percentage of the
candidate’s surplus funds, equal to the percentage of the total amount in contributions the candidate received that were
public funds from the democracy credit program. Otherwise,
the surplus funds must be disposed of in any one or more of
the following ways:
(1) Return the surplus to a contributor in an amount not to
exceed that contributor’s original contribution;
(2) Using surplus, reimburse the candidate for lost earnings incurred as a result of that candidate’s election campaign. Lost earnings shall be verifiable as unpaid salary for
the specific time period of the election campaign or, when
the candidate is not salaried, as an amount not to exceed
income received by the candidate for services rendered
during an appropriate, corresponding time period. Any reimbursement may not exceed an amount equal to the estimated median household income for the state as determined by
the office of financial management and calculated pro rata
by the commission in relation to such time period. All lost
earnings incurred shall be documented and a record thereof shall be maintained by the candidate or the candidate’s
authorized committee. The committee shall maintain a copy
of this record in accordance with RCW 42.17A.235(((6))) (5);
(3) Transfer the surplus without limit to a political party or
to a caucus political committee;
(4) Donate the surplus to a charitable organization registered in accordance with chapter 19.09 RCW;
(5) Transmit the surplus to the state treasurer for deposit in
the general fund, the campaign financing and enforcement
fund created in section 18 of this act, the Washington state
legacy project, state library, and archives account under
RCW 43.07.380, or the legislative international trade account under RCW 43.15.050, as specified by the candidate
or political committee; or
(6) ((Hold the surplus in the depository or depositories
designated in accordance with RCW 42.17A.215 for possible use in a future election campaign for the same office
last sought by the candidate and report any such disposition in accordance with RCW 42.17A.240. If the candidate
subsequently announces or publicly files for office, the appropriate information must be reported to the commission
in accordance with RCW 42.17A.205 through 42.17A.240.
If a subsequent office is not sought the surplus held shall
be disposed of in accordance with the requirements of this
section.
(7))) Hold the surplus campaign funds in a separate account for nonreimbursed public office-related expenses or
as provided in this section, and report any such disposition
in accordance with RCW 42.17A.240. The separate account
required under this subsection shall not be used for deposits
of campaign funds that are not surplus.
(((8))) No candidate or authorized committee may transfer
funds to any other candidate or other political committee.
The disposal of surplus funds under this section shall not
be considered a contribution for purposes of this chapter.

(2) An elected or appointed official, serving in state or local
government after the effective date of this section, may not

CITIZEN FINANCING OF ELECTIONS
NEW SECTION. Sec. 9. The democracy credit program is
hereby established within the commission. The purposes of
the program are to promote broad, diverse, fair, and undistorted citizen influence and participation in electoral politics;
encourage citizens with meaningful voter support to run for
office, and facilitate the process by which they connect with
voters; minimize the perception of corruption in government;
better inform the public about candidates running for office;
and promote meaningful and open discussion of political
issues in the context of electoral politics. The commission
shall seek to further these purposes whenever it enacts rules
to govern the program pursuant to the authority granted in
this chapter.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 10. The definitions in this section
apply throughout this subchapter unless the context clearly
requires otherwise:
(1) “Contribution period” means the time period, to be determined by the commission by rule, during which an eligible
individual may make a democracy credit contribution for a
given election year. Unless the commission determines otherwise, the contribution period shall begin on April 1st of the
relevant election year.
(2) “Democracy credit contribution” means a campaign
contribution made by an eligible individual from the program
fund to a qualified state candidate, pursuant to the rules of
the program.
(3) “Eligible individual” means an individual properly registered to vote in the state, or an individual verified by the
commission for participation in the program pursuant to
section 16 of this act.
(4) “Program” means the democracy credit program.
(5) “Program fund” or “program funds” means the funds
of the commission that the commission has allocated to the
democracy credit program specifically for use as democracy
credit contributions, including funds appropriated and allocated pursuant to section 18 of this act.
(6) “Qualified state candidate” means a candidate for state
office whose status as a candidate eligible to receive democracy credit contributions has been certified by the commission.
(7) “Qualifying contribution” means a contribution to a
candidate that is not, in the aggregate from any contributor,
in excess of fifty percent of any applicable contribution limit
under state law, other than limits on contributions from bona
fide political parties or caucus political committees, or that is
not, in the aggregate from any contributor, in excess of an alternative amount set by rule that the commission determines
is necessary to promote the purposes of the program.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 11. (1) For elections in even-numbered years, the commission shall, at least ten business
days before the beginning of the contribution period, send
by postal mail to each eligible individual, using the address
specified on the individual’s voter registration or verification
materials, personalized materials for the program. Thereafter, until one week before the general election of that year,
unless no program funds remain available for democracy
credit contributions, the commission shall send personalized materials to each individual who becomes an eligible
individual, within ten business days of the individual obtaining status as an eligible individual.
(2) The personalized materials sent to each eligible individual must:
(a) Be addressed to the name of the eligible individual;
(b) Be sent in an official commission envelope;
(c) Provide information about the purposes and workings
of the program, instructions on how to access the section
of the commission’s web site where complete information
about the program can be found, and the telephone number for the commission’s program assistance hotline or other
similar means for contacting the commission for assistance;
(d) Clearly inform the recipient of the program’s rules and
penalties;
(e) Provide a unique and nonsequential pin code, or equivalently secure verification credential, for each of the democracy credit contributions that the eligible individual may
make during the contribution period; and
(f) Provide instructions for how to make a democracy credit contribution.
(3) The secretary of state’s office and all county elections
departments shall work closely with the commission and any
involved contractors to ensure that the commission has access to continuously accurate voter registration information.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 12. (1) For elections in each
even-numbered year, each eligible individual is authorized
to make up to three democracy credit contributions during
the contribution period, subject to the availability of program
funds. The amount of each democracy credit contribution is
fifty dollars. The commission shall set the contribution peri-
106 Initiative Measure No. 1464
od by rule to promote ease of program administration and to
promote the purposes of the program under section 9 of this
act. The commission may also adjust the number of authorized democracy credit contributions and the contribution
amount, including setting different amounts by office, if necessary to promote program participation by candidates or
eligible individuals, or if necessary to incentivize candidates
to spend significant time appealing to eligible individuals. In
making such adjustments, the commission must consider
the historical costs of running viable campaigns, the anticipated availability of program funds, and the anticipated
number of qualified state candidates.
(2) A democracy credit contribution shall be treated as a
contribution made by the eligible individual. The value of a
democracy credit contribution is not income or a monetary
asset of the eligible individual. A person may not transfer
to another person the ability to make a democracy credit
contribution or the verification credentials required to make
a democracy credit contribution. Except as required to make
a reasonable accommodation for a disability or as otherwise
allowed by law, a democracy credit contribution may not be
authorized by proxy, power of attorney, or agent. Any county
elections department shall provide assistance in making democracy credit contributions to eligible individuals who visit
the department.
(3) To make a democracy credit contribution, an eligible
individual must, using the electronic authorization system
developed by the commission under section 16 of this act,
attest to understanding the rules and penalties of the program and provide the following information:
(a) Personal identifying information, as required by the
commission to ensure accuracy and prevent fraud and
abuse, which unless determined otherwise by the commission must include name and residential or mailing address
as recorded in the eligible individual’s voter registration or
verification materials, date of birth, and whichever of the following the individual used to register to vote in the state or
to be verified as an eligible individual: Social security number
or Washington driver’s license, permit, or identicard number;
(b) The unique pin code or equivalently secure verification
credential provided by the commission for the democracy
credit contribution to be made; and
(c) The identity of the qualified state candidate to whom
the eligible individual wishes to make the democracy credit
contribution.
(4) As necessary to promote the purposes of the program
under section 9 of this act, the commission may allow eligible individuals to request and receive from the commission
a paper form that may be used, as an alternative to the electronic process detailed under subsection (3) of this section,
to make a democracy credit contribution. Before the implementation of any such forms, the commission must develop
rules to govern their use.
(5) Upon receiving the information required for a democracy credit contribution, and upon confirming that the provided information is valid, that sufficient program funds are
available, and that the contemplated contribution is permitted, the commission shall transfer the democracy credit
contribution from the program fund to the candidate committee of the qualified state candidate chosen by the eligible individual. The commission may set by rule a minimum
number of days that must elapse before the contribution is
transferred from the program fund, as necessary to prevent
mistake, fraud, and abuse.
(6) A candidate committee may reject a democracy credit
contribution. The commission shall notify any eligible individual whose democracy credit contribution has been rejected and reissue the information and verification credentials
necessary to allow that individual to make that democracy
credit contribution to another qualified state candidate.
(7) The commission shall, using the information available
to it and to the extent practicable, minimize any administrative burdens on candidate committees resulting from the
application of general reporting requirements to democracy
credit contributions.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 13. (1) In 2018, 2020, and 2022,
only a candidate running for state legislative office may be
a qualified state candidate. The commission shall determine
the additional offices for which a candidate may be a qualified state candidate in 2024 and each even-numbered year
thereafter, with the purpose of expanding the program to as
many offices as possible while ensuring sufficient program
funds for such expansion, and prioritizing the offices of governor, secretary of state, attorney general, commissioner of
public lands, and justice of the supreme court.
(2) To become a qualified state candidate, a candidate
must submit, within a period to be determined by the commission by rule, a registration form to be developed by the
commission. The form must be signed by the candidate and
any treasurer for the candidate’s campaign committee. To be
certified by the commission as a qualified state candidate,
the candidate seeking registration must:
(a) Indicate willingness to receive democracy credit contributions and an understanding and acceptance of program
rules and penalties;
(b) Demonstrate collection of the required number of qualifying contributions from unique natural persons residing
in the geographic district or area electing the office being
sought, of at least ten dollars each, during a period to be
determined by the commission by rule; and
(c) Attest that the candidate:
(i) Will not use personal funds in connection with the candidate’s election in excess of applicable program limits;
(ii) Will not solicit, accept, direct, or otherwise coordinate
receipt or spending of funds in connection with the candidate’s election other than personal funds in accordance with
this subsection (2)(c)(i), democracy credit contributions, and
qualifying contributions, except at times when the candidate
would be eligible for democracy credit contributions but no
program funds are available for that purpose;
(iii) Will not solicit, accept, direct, or otherwise coordinate
receipt or spending of funds, other than democracy credit contributions and qualifying contributions, in connection
with any other election; 
Initiative Measure No. 1464 107
(iv) Has not at the time of submitting the statement accepted or spent funds in connection with the candidate’s election
other than personal funds in accordance with (c)(i) of this
subsection (2) and qualifying contributions, or has (A) been
reimbursed any amount of personal funds spent in excess
of the limits in (c)(i) of this subsection (2), and (B) refunded
any amounts received in excess of the limits on qualifying
contributions to each original contributor or, to the extent
refunding to the original contributor is not possible, then to
the program fund;
(v) Will not make contributions to another political committee using funds received as democracy credit contributions;
(vi) Will promptly make available to the commission at any
time the books of account associated with the campaign;
and
(vii) Will abide by any additional requirements that the commission has set by rule, which the commission shall adopt
as needed to prevent circumvention and otherwise promote
the purposes of the program under section 9 of this act.
(3) Once the filing period set forth in RCW 29A.24.050
ends, a candidate may not become or remain a qualified
state candidate unless he or she has properly filed a declaration of candidacy pursuant to chapter 29A.24 RCW.
(4) A qualified state candidate running for state legislative
office may not use personal funds exceeding five thousand
dollars in the aggregate for campaign purposes. The commission shall determine a limit on the use of personal funds
for all other state candidates by office, in amounts that account for the reasonable costs of starting a viable campaign
while promoting campaigns that are based on widespread
underlying community support. The commission may adjust
these limits over time, including for legislative office, based
on changed circumstances that make such adjustment necessary to account for campaign startup costs or to promote
campaigns based on widespread underlying community
support.
(5) The number of qualifying contributions of at least ten
dollars each required under subsection (2) of this section to
become a qualified state candidate is seventy-five for a candidate for state legislative office. The commission shall determine the required number for all other state candidates by
office, in amounts that promote program participation while
preventing fraud and preventing waste of public funds on
candidates unable to obtain meaningful public support. The
commission may adjust these numbers over time, including
the numbers for legislative office, based on changed circumstances that make such adjustment necessary to promote
program participation, prevent fraud, prevent waste of public
funds, or otherwise promote the purposes of the program.
(6) If the commission receives a valid registration form from
a state candidate, it shall verify the submitted information,
and if all required information has been received and verified,
shall certify the candidate’s registration as a qualified state
candidate who may receive democracy credit contributions
during the contribution period in accordance with program
rules. The commission shall then promptly update all online
materials to reflect this change in status.
(7) A qualified state candidate is eligible to receive no more
than the following in the aggregate in democracy credit contributions for a single election year: For a candidate for state
representative, one hundred fifty thousand dollars; for a candidate for state senator, two hundred fifty thousand dollars.
The commission shall determine the limits applicable to candidates for all other state offices, in amounts that promote
program participation while also promoting equitable availability of program funds among qualified state candidates.
The commission may adjust these limits over time, including
the limits for state representative and state senator, based
on changed circumstances that make such adjustment necessary to promote program participation or to promote the
equitable availability of program funds among qualified state
candidates.
(8)(a) A qualified state candidate may use democracy
credit contribution proceeds only:
(i) For campaign costs or campaign debts for the relevant
election; and
(ii) During the election cycle and, as set by commission
rule, for a reasonable period following the election.
(b) A qualified state candidate may not use democracy
credit contribution proceeds to pay:
(i) The candidate or candidate’s immediate family member, except to reimburse for actual out-of-pocket campaign
expenses;
(ii) Any entity in which the candidate or an immediate family member holds in aggregate a ten percent or greater ownership interest;
(iii) Any amount over fair market value for any services,
goods, facilities, or things of value;
(iv) Any penalty or fine; or
(v) Any inaugural costs or postelection officeholder costs.
(9) A candidate loses status as a qualified state candidate
by publicly announcing withdrawal, abandoning the race,
losing a primary election, losing or winning a general election, becoming ineligible for the office sought, if the commission finds the candidate has recklessly or intentionally
committed a material violation of election laws or program
requirements, or if the candidate is otherwise disqualified
for violating this chapter pursuant to rules set by the commission. A candidate who loses status as a qualified state
candidate shall, within a reasonable period as set by commission rule, pay all debts and obligations, account to the
commission, and remit to the program fund a certain percentage of remaining funds, equal to the percentage of the
total amount in contributions the candidate received that
came from democracy credit contributions. If the commission at any time rescinds qualified state candidate status
based on a violation of program requirements, the candidate
shall also pay a penalty to the program fund to be set by the
commission by rule.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 14. (1) Beginning in 2021, the commission shall consider whether there are sufficient program
funds to expand the program to cover elections that occur
in odd-numbered years. If the commission determines that
such expansion would further the purposes of the program 
108
under section 9 of this act, it shall implement the expansion.
(2) In 2022, the commission shall request an opinion from
the attorney general as to whether the program can be lawfully expanded to include federal candidates for the offices
of United States representative for the state of Washington
and United States senator for the state of Washington. The
attorney general shall provide the requested opinion.
(a) If the attorney general opines that such expansion can
be done lawfully, and the commission then determines that
such expansion would further the purposes of the program
under section 9 of this act, the commission shall implement
the expansion.
(b) If the attorney general opines that such expansion cannot be done lawfully, the commission shall wait for a material
change in circumstances and then request another opinion,
which is subject to (a) and (b) of this subsection (2).
(c) If the program is expanded to include federal candidates, the commission shall adopt reasonable rules governing the qualification and participation of such candidates
and, notwithstanding RCW 42.17A.485, the commission
may allow eligible individuals to receive direct refunds from
the program fund for contributions to such candidates.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 15. (1) A person who knowingly offers to make a democracy credit contribution in exchange
for cash or any other consideration, or who knowingly offers
to buy or sell a democracy credit contribution, the ability to
make a democracy credit contribution, or personalized information contained in program materials is guilty of a gross
misdemeanor.
(2) A person who makes a democracy credit contribution in
exchange for cash or any other consideration, or who buys
or sells a democracy credit contribution, the ability to make
a democracy credit contribution, or personalized information
contained in program materials is guilty of a class C felony.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 16. (1) The commission shall contract for the development and management of a private and
secure electronic system that controls and administers all
technical aspects of the program, as well as a public online
portal, accessible by normal and secure means, such as by
common internet browsers on computers and mobile phones
or other common devices with internet access, through
which eligible individuals may make democracy credit contributions. When awarding such a contract, the commission
shall give preference to any contractor with demonstrated
experience and success in developing technologies similar
to those being contracted for. No contractor, subcontractor,
or associated entity may sell, license, or otherwise distribute
data, metadata, or any information acquired through these
contracts to any entity other than the commission, the public as required by this chapter, or entities approved by the
commission.
(2) The commission shall implement the program on an
ongoing basis, including by:
(a) Continuously managing the spending of all program
funds with a goal of promoting the long-term success and
sustainability of the program;
(b) Promoting awareness and understanding of the program with the goal of maximizing widespread and diverse
citizen and candidate participation in the program;
(c) Supervising the management of the system and portal
described in subsection (1) of this section;

the option to download without cost a bulk data file containing that information;
(e) Publishing appropriate guidebooks for candidates and
eligible individuals, and translations of the informational web
site and key program materials into languages spoken by a
significant number of state residents, as determined by the
commission;

residents may receive information about the program, request assistance with program issues, and submit complaints about problems related to democracy credit contributions or personalized materials;
(g) During each contribution period, auditing the books of
account of at least two percent of qualified state candidates,
to be chosen by random selection;
(h) Releasing a comprehensive report to the public every

its use during the previous even-numbered election year;
and
(i) Enforcing program requirements and investigating potential violations of such requirements, including by reviewing the books of account associated with the campaign of
any qualified state candidate when appropriate.
(3) The commission shall adopt regulations to govern the
program, designed to effectuate the provisions of sections
9 through 15 of this act, prevent circumvention and fraud,
promote accessibility and participation, address violations
of program requirements, and otherwise promote the purposes of the program. The commission’s regulations may
include special civil penalties or other remedies for violations
of program requirements.
(4) By December 1, 2019, the commission shall develop
and adopt regulations to allow any adult natural person
who is a bona fide resident of the state, not eligible to
register to vote under state law, but eligible under state
and federal law to donate to a candidate campaign, to
request to be verified by the commission as an eligible
individual for participation in the program in the year 2020
and thereafter. The commission shall develop a process to
reasonably ensure that an individual who no longer meets
the requirements necessary to be an eligible individual does
not make a democracy credit contribution until the individual
again meets such requirements.

(h) The court may enjoin any person to prevent the doing
of any act herein prohibited, or to compel the performance

(2) The commission may refer the following violations for
criminal prosecution:
(a) A person who, with actual malice, violates a provision
of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor under chapter 9.92
RCW;

any false or forged document to be filed, registered, or recorded with the commission under this chapter is guilty of a
class C felony under chapter 9.94A RCW.
Sec. 24. RCW 42.17A.755 and 2011 c 145 s 7 are each
amended to read as follows:
(1) The commission may (a) determine whether an actual
violation of this chapter has occurred; and (b) issue and enforce an appropriate order following such a determination.
(2) The commission, in cases where it chooses to determine whether an actual violation has occurred, shall hold a
hearing pursuant to the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW, to make a determination. Any order that the
commission issues under this section shall be pursuant to
such a hearing.
(3) In lieu of holding a hearing or issuing an order under this
section, the commission may refer the matter to the attorney
general or other enforcement agency as provided in RCW
42.17A.105.
(4) The person against whom an order is directed under
this section shall be designated as the respondent. The order may require the respondent to cease and desist from or
to take affirmative steps to remedy the activity that constitutes a violation and in addition, or alternatively, may impose
Initiative Measure No. 1464
111
one or more of the remedies provided in RCW 42.17A.750(1)
(b) through (((e))) (g). ((The commission may assess a penalty
in an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars.))
(5) The commission has the authority to waive a fine for
a first-time violation. A second violation of the same rule
by the same person or individual, regardless if the person
or individual committed the violation for a different political
committee, shall result in a fine. Succeeding violations of the
same rule shall result in successively increased fines.
(6) An order issued by the commission under this section
shall be subject to judicial review under the administrative
procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW. If the commission’s order is not satisfied and no petition for review is filed within
thirty days, the commission may petition a court of competent jurisdiction of any county in which a petition for review
could be filed under that section, for an order of enforcement. Proceedings in connection with the commission’s petition shall be in accordance with RCW 42.17A.760.
(7) The commission is directed to consider timely enforcement of this chapter to be of the utmost importance. The
commission is directed to use the full extent of its enforcement authority under this chapter to identify and address
violations without delay, including by enjoining ongoing or
impending violations, before each relevant election whenever possible.
(8) Any penalties imposed by the commission and collected in accordance with this section are awarded half to the
state and half directly to the commission, which must use
the funds for the purpose of preventing and investigating
potential violations of this chapter. If the violation is found
to have been intentional, the commission may also assess
all related costs of investigation and enforcement, including
attorneys’ fees. If damages are assessed against a lobbyist,
the judgment may be awarded not only against the lobbyist but also, jointly, severally, or both, against any employer
or employers of the lobbyist joined as defendants who are
found to have acted recklessly or intentionally in relation to
the violation.
Sec. 25. RCW 42.17A.765 and 2010 c 204 s 1004 are
each amended to read as follows:
(1) The attorney general and the prosecuting authorities
of political subdivisions of this state may bring civil actions
in the name of the state for any appropriate civil remedy for
violations of this chapter, including but not limited to the
special remedies provided in RCW 42.17A.750. In such civil
actions, any amounts awarded for violations of this chapter
are awarded half to the state and half directly to the commission, which must use the funds for the purpose of preventing
and investigating potential violations of this chapter.
(2) The attorney general and the prosecuting authorities of
political subdivisions of this state may investigate or cause
to be investigated the activities of any person who there is
reason to believe is or has been acting in violation of this
chapter, and may require any such person or any other person reasonably believed to have information concerning
the activities of such person to appear at a time and place
designated in the county in which such person resides or is
found, to give such information under oath and to produce
all accounts, bills, receipts, books, paper and documents
which may be relevant or material to any investigation authorized under this chapter.
(3) When the attorney general or the prosecuting authority
of any political subdivision of this state requires the attendance of any person to obtain such information or produce
the accounts, bills, receipts, books, papers, and documents
that may be relevant or material to any investigation authorized under this chapter, he or she shall issue an order setting forth the time when and the place where attendance
is required and shall cause the same to be delivered to or
sent by registered mail to the person at least fourteen days
before the date fixed for attendance. The order shall have
the same force and effect as a subpoena, shall be effective
statewide, and, upon application of the attorney general or
the prosecuting authority, obedience to the order may be
enforced by any superior court judge in the county where
the person receiving it resides or is found, in the same manner as though the order were a subpoena. The court, after
hearing, for good cause, and upon application of any person
aggrieved by the order, shall have the right to alter, amend,
revise, suspend, or postpone all or any part of its provisions.
In any case where the order is not enforced by the court according to its terms, the reasons for the court’s actions shall
be clearly stated in writing, and the action shall be subject to
review by the appellate courts by certiorari or other appropriate proceeding.
(4) A person who has notified the attorney general and the
prosecuting attorney in the county in which the violation occurred in writing that there is reason to believe that some
provision of this chapter is being or has been violated may
himself or herself bring ((in the name of the state any of the
actions)) a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state against the alleged violator (hereinafter referred to as a citizen’s action) for
any of the remedies authorized under this chapter.
(a) This citizen action may be brought only if:
(i) The attorney general and the prosecuting attorney have
failed to commence an action hereunder within forty-five
days after the notice;
(ii) The person has thereafter further notified the attorney
general and prosecuting attorney that the person will commence a citizen’s action within ten days upon their failure to
do so;
(iii) The attorney general and the prosecuting attorney have
in fact failed to bring such action within ten days of receipt of
said second notice; and
(iv) The citizen’s action is filed within two years after the
date when the alleged violation occurred.
(b) In case of an alleged ongoing or impending violation of
this chapter occurring within sixty days before an election
and having the potential to affect the outcome, the citizen
action may be brought during that period without regard to
(a) of this subsection, including for injunctive relief and any
other remedy authorized by law, but only if:
(i) The person has notified the attorney general and prosecuting attorney that the person will commence a citizen’s
Initiative Measure No. 1464
112
action within ten days upon their failure to do so; and
(ii) The attorney general and the prosecuting attorney have
in fact failed to bring such action within ten days of receipt
of said notice.
(c) If the person who brings the citizen’s action prevails, the
judgment awarded shall escheat to the state, but he or she
shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the state of Washington for reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees he or she has
incurred. In the case of a citizen’s action that is dismissed
and that the court also finds was brought without reasonable cause, the court may order the person commencing the
action to pay all costs of trial and reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred by the defendant.
(5) In any action brought under this section in which a violation is found, the court may award to the state all costs of
investigation and trial, including reasonable attorneys’ fees
to be fixed by the court. If the violation is found to have been
intentional, the amount of the judgment, which shall for this
purpose include the costs, may in the court’s discretion be
trebled as punitive damages. If damages or trebled damages are awarded in such an action brought against a lobbyist,
the judgment may be awarded not only against the lobbyist
but also jointly, severally, or both against ((the lobbyist, and
the lobbyist’s)) any employer or employers of the lobbyist
joined as defendants((, jointly, severally, or both)) who are
found to have acted recklessly or intentionally in relation to
the violation. If the defendant prevails against the attorney
general or prosecuting attorney, he or she shall be awarded
all costs of trial, and may in the court’s discretion be awarded reasonable attorneys’ fees to be fixed by the court to be
paid by the state of Washington.
(6) The attorney general and the prosecuting authorities
of political subdivisions of this state are directed to consider
timely enforcement of this chapter to be of the utmost importance. The attorney general and prosecuting authorities
are directed to use the full extent of their enforcement authority under this chapter to identify and address violations
without delay, including by obtaining injunctions to stop any
ongoing or impending violations, before each relevant election whenever possible.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 26. (1) A person may not use contributions to pay a penalty or other amount that is owed as a
result of violating this chapter or that is owed under this section, except to the extent that the person cannot otherwise
pay and the amount cannot be collected under subsection
(2) of this section.
(2) If a political committee or other entity is found liable
for violating this chapter, and a penalty or other amount assessed against the entity cannot be collected other than
by the entity’s use of contributions, the following additional
persons are personally liable for the amount owed if such
persons recklessly or intentionally contributed to the violation through action or inaction and justice so requires the
imposition of liability:
(a) For a violation by a political committee, then an officer
of the committee or a person who directed the activities of
the committee;
(b) For a violation by a corporation, then a director or officer of the corporation;
(c) For a violation by a political committee, corporation, or
other entity, then a person occupying a similar position of
authority or control.
(3) For purposes of this section, a person acts recklessly
when he or she knows of and disregards a substantial risk
that a violation may occur and his or her disregard of such
substantial risk is a gross deviation from conduct that a reasonable person would exercise in the same situation.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 27. (1) The commission shall maintain and make available to the public a telephone hotline for
the submission of tips regarding potential violations of this
chapter. Persons submitting such tips must be given the option of remaining anonymous. The commission has discretion to determine whether to investigate any tip.
(2) Any elected office, lobbyist, or political committee, if it
has employees, must prominently post a notice of the hotline
established in subsection (1) of this section in a place where
all employees have reasonable access to it. The notice must
clearly indicate that the hotline is available to submit anonymous tips on potential violations of campaign finance and
disclosure laws. The commission shall establish and make
available a sample notice that qualifies if posted in accordance with the commission’s instructions.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 28. A new section is added to chapter 42.17A RCW to read as follows:
(1) By January 1, 2018, all agencies required to report under RCW 42.17A.635 must file all reports required by this
chapter electronically over the internet as provided by the
commission under RCW 42.17A.055.
(2) By January 1, 2018, all lobbyists and lobbyists’ employers required to file reports under RCW 42.17A.600,
42.17A.615, 42.17A.625, or 42.17A.630 must file all reports
required by this chapter electronically over the internet as
provided by the commission under RCW 42.17A.055.
(3) The commission shall oversee and ensure the design,
development, implementation, and maintenance of computer hardware and software or other applications to accommodate electronic filing of the reports required by this section
and a database and query system compatible with current
architecture, technology, and operating systems that result
in readily available data to the public for review and analysis.
The commission is encouraged to engage stakeholders in
the design and development of the system.
Sec. 29. RCW 42.17A.125 and 2011 c 60 s 21 are each
amended to read as follows:
(1) At the beginning of each even-numbered calendar year,
the commission shall, based on changes in economic conditions as reflected in the inflationary index recommended
by the office of financial management, increase or decrease
the dollar amounts in RCW 42.17A.005(26), 42.17A.320,
42.17A.405, 42.17A.410, 42.17A.445(3), 42.17A.475, ((and))
42.17A.630(1) ((based on changes in economic conditions
as reflected in the inflationary index recommended by the
office of financial management)), 42.17A.750, 42.17A.765,
sections 4, 13(4), and 21 of this act, as lawfully amended by
Initiative Measure No. 1464
113
the commission over time. The new dollar amounts established by the commission under this section shall be rounded off to amounts as judged most convenient for public understanding and so as to be within ten percent of the target
amount equal to the base amount provided in this chapter,
as amended, multiplied by the increase in the inflationary
index since ((July 2008)) the most recent amendment to the
base amount.
(2) The commission may revise, at least once every five
years but no more often than every two years, the monetary
reporting thresholds and reporting code values of this chapter. The revisions shall be only for the purpose of recognizing
economic changes as reflected by an inflationary index recommended by the office of financial management, or to provide more detailed information to the public. The inflationary
revisions shall be guided by the change in the index for the
period commencing with the month of December preceding the last revision and concluding with the month of December preceding the month the revision is adopted. As to
each of the three general categories of this chapter, reports
of campaign finance, reports of lobbyist activity, and reports
of the financial affairs of elected and appointed officials, the
inflationary revisions shall equally affect all thresholds within
each category. The inflationary revisions authorized by this
subsection shall reflect economic changes from the time of
the last legislative enactment affecting the respective code
or threshold.
(3) Revisions made in accordance with subsections (1) and
(2) of this section shall be adopted as rules under chapter
34.05 RCW.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 30. The following acts or parts of

Complete Text
Initiative Measure No. 1491
AN ACT Relating to extreme risk protection orders; adding
a new chapter to Title 7 RCW; and prescribing penalties.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF
WASHINGTON:
NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. INTENT. (1) This act is designed to
temporarily prevent individuals who are at high risk of harming themselves or others from accessing firearms by allowing family, household members, and police to obtain a court
order when there is demonstrated evidence that the person
poses a significant danger, including danger as a result of a
dangerous mental health crisis or violent behavior.
(2) Every year, over one hundred thousand people are
victims of gunshot wounds and more than thirty thousand
of those victims lose their lives. Over the last five years for
which data is available, one hundred sixty-four thousand
eight hundred twenty-one people in America were killed with
firearms—an average of ninety-one deaths each day.
(3) Studies show that individuals who engage in certain
dangerous behaviors are significantly more likely to commit violence toward themselves or others in the near future.
These behaviors, which can include other acts or threats of
violence, self-harm, or the abuse of drugs or alcohol, are
warning signs that the person may soon commit an act of
violence.
(4) Individuals who pose a danger to themselves or others often exhibit signs that alert family, household members,
or law enforcement to the threat. Many mass shooters displayed warning signs prior to their killings, but federal and
state laws provided no clear legal process to suspend the
shooters’ access to guns, even temporarily.
(5) In enacting this initiative, it is the purpose and intent of
the people to reduce gun deaths and injuries, while respecting constitutional rights, by providing a court procedure for
family, household members, and law enforcement to obtain
an order temporarily restricting a person’s access to firearms. Court orders are intended to be limited to situations
in which the person poses a significant danger of harming
themselves or others by possessing a firearm and include
standards and safeguards to protect the rights of respondents and due process of law.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 2. SHORT TITLE. This act may be
known and cited as the extreme risk protection order act.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 3. DEFINITIONS. The definitions in
this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context
clearly requires otherwise.
(1) “Extreme risk protection order” means an ex parte temporary order or a final order granted under this chapter.
(2) “Family or household member” means, with respect to
a respondent, any: (a) Person related by blood, marriage, or
adoption to the respondent; (b) Dating partners of the respondent; (c) Person who has a child in common with the
respondent, regardless of whether such person has been
married to the respondent or has lived together with the respondent at any time; (d) Person who resides or has resided with the respondent within the past year; (e) Domestic
partner of the respondent; (f) Person who has a biological or
legal parent-child relationship with the respondent, including
stepparents and stepchildren and grandparents and grandchildren; and (g) Person who is acting or has acted as the
respondent’s legal guardian.
(3) “Petitioner” means the person who petitions for an order under this chapter.
(4) “Respondent” means the person who is identified as
the respondent in a petition filed under this chapter.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 4. PETITION FOR AN EXTREME
RISK PROTECTION ORDER. There shall exist an action
known as a petition for an extreme risk protection order.
(1) A petition for an extreme risk protection order may be
filed by (a) a family or household member of the respondent
or (b) a law enforcement officer or agency.
(2) An action under this chapter must be filed in the county
where the petitioner resides or the county where the respondent resides.
(3) A petition must:
(a) Allege that the respondent poses a significant danger
of causing personal injury to self or others by having in his or
her custody or control, purchasing, possessing, or receiving
a firearm, and be accompanied by an affidavit made under
oath stating the specific statements, actions, or facts that
give rise to a reasonable fear of future dangerous acts by the
respondent;
(b) Identify the number, types, and locations of any firearms the petitioner believes to be in the respondent’s current
ownership, possession, custody, or control;
(c) Identify whether there is a known existing protection
order governing the respondent, under chapter 7.90, 7.92,
10.14, 9A.46, 10.99, 26.50, or 26.52 RCW or under any other
applicable statute; and
(d) Identify whether there is a pending lawsuit, complaint,
petition, or other action between the parties to the petition
under the laws of Washington.
(4) The court administrator shall verify the terms of any existing order governing the parties. The court may not delay
granting relief because of the existence of a pending action
between the parties or the necessity of verifying the terms of
an existing order. A petition for an extreme risk protection order may be granted whether or not there is a pending action
between the parties.
(5) If the petitioner is a law enforcement officer or agency, the petitioner shall make a good faith effort to provide
notice to a family or household member of the respondent
and to any known third party who may be at risk of violence.
The notice must state that the petitioner intends to petition
the court for an extreme risk protection order or has already
done so, and include referrals to appropriate resources, including mental health, domestic violence, and counseling
resources. The petitioner must attest in the petition to having 
Initiative Measure No. 1491 115
provided such notice, or attest to the steps that will be taken
to provide such notice.
(6) If the petition states that disclosure of the petitioner’s
address would risk harm to the petitioner or any member of
the petitioner’s family or household, the petitioner’s address
may be omitted from all documents filed with the court. If
the petitioner has not disclosed an address under this subsection, the petitioner must designate an alternative address
at which the respondent may serve notice of any motions. If
the petitioner is a law enforcement officer or agency, the address of record must be that of the law enforcement agency.
(7) Within ninety days of receipt of the master copy from
the administrative office of the courts, all court clerk’s offices shall make available the standardized forms, instructions, and informational brochures required by section 16 of
this act. Any assistance or information provided by clerks
under this section does not constitute the practice of law
and clerks are not responsible for incorrect information contained in a petition.
(8) No fees for filing or service of process may be charged
by a court or any public agency to petitioners seeking relief
under this chapter. Petitioners shall be provided the necessary number of certified copies, forms, and instructional brochures free of charge.
(9) A person is not required to post a bond to obtain relief
in any proceeding under this section.
(10) The superior courts of the state of Washington have
jurisdiction over proceedings under this chapter. Additionally, district and municipal courts have limited jurisdiction over
issuance and enforcement of ex parte extreme risk protection orders issued under section 6 of this act. The district or
municipal court shall set the full hearing provided for in section 5 of this act in superior court and transfer the case. If the
notice and order are not served on the respondent in time for
the full hearing, the issuing court has concurrent jurisdiction
with the superior court to extend the ex parte extreme risk
protection order.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 5. EXTREME RISK PROTECTION
ORDER HEARINGS AND ISSUANCE. (1) Upon receipt of the
petition, the court shall order a hearing to be held not later
than fourteen days from the date of the order and issue a
notice of hearing to the respondent for the same.
(a) The court may schedule a hearing by telephone pursuant to local court rule, to reasonably accommodate a disability, or in exceptional circumstances to protect a petitioner
from potential harm. The court shall require assurances of
the petitioner’s identity before conducting a telephonic hearing.
(b) The court clerk shall cause a copy of the notice of
hearing and petition to be forwarded on or before the next
judicial day to the appropriate law enforcement agency for
service upon the respondent.
(c) Personal service of the notice of hearing and petition
shall be made upon the respondent by a law enforcement
officer not less than five court days prior to the hearing. Service issued under this section takes precedence over the
service of other documents, unless the other documents
are of a similar emergency nature. If timely personal service
cannot be made, the court shall set a new hearing date and
shall either require additional attempts at obtaining personal
service or permit service by publication or mail as provided
in section 8 of this act. The court shall not require more than
two attempts at obtaining personal service and shall permit
service by publication or mail after two attempts at obtaining personal service unless the petitioner requests additional
time to attempt personal service. If the court issues an order
permitting service by publication or mail, the court shall set
the hearing date not later than twenty-four days from the
date the order issues.
(d) The court may, as provided in section 6 of this act, issue an ex parte extreme risk protection order pending the
hearing ordered under this subsection (1). Such ex parte order must be served concurrently with the notice of hearing
and petition.
(2) Upon hearing the matter, if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent poses a significant danger of causing personal injury to self or others by
having in his or her custody or control, purchasing, possessing, or receiving a firearm, the court shall issue an extreme
risk protection order for a period of one year.
(3) In determining whether grounds for an extreme risk
protection order exist, the court may consider any relevant
evidence including, but not limited to, any of the following:
(a) A recent act or threat of violence by the respondent
against self or others, whether or not such violence or threat
of violence involves a firearm;
(b) A pattern of acts or threats of violence by the respondent within the past twelve months including, but not limited
to, acts or threats of violence by the respondent against self
or others;
(c) Any dangerous mental health issues of the respondent;
(d) A violation by the respondent of a protection order or
a no-contact order issued under chapter 7.90, 7.92, 10.14,
9A.46, 10.99, 26.50, or 26.52 RCW;
(e) A previous or existing extreme risk protection order issued against the respondent;
(f) A violation of a previous or existing extreme risk protection order issued against the respondent;
(g) A conviction of the respondent for a crime that constitutes domestic violence as defined in RCW 10.99.020;
(h) The respondent’s ownership, access to, or intent to
possess firearms;
(i) The unlawful or reckless use, display, or brandishing of
a firearm by the respondent;
(j) The history of use, attempted use, or threatened use of
physical force by the respondent against another person, or
the respondent’s history of stalking another person;
(k) Any prior arrest of the respondent for a felony offense
or violent crime;
(l) Corroborated evidence of the abuse of controlled substances or alcohol by the respondent; and
(m) Evidence of recent acquisition of firearms by the respondent. 
116
(4) The court may:
(a) Examine under oath the petitioner, the respondent, and
any witnesses they may produce, or, in lieu of examination,
consider sworn affidavits of the petitioner, the respondent,
and any witnesses they may produce; and
(b) Ensure that a reasonable search has been conducted
for criminal history records related to the respondent.
(5) In a hearing under this chapter, the rules of evidence
apply to the same extent as in a domestic violence protection order proceeding under chapter 26.50 RCW.
(6) During the hearing, the court shall consider whether a
mental health evaluation or chemical dependency evaluation

(4) Upon the sworn statement or testimony of the petitioner or of any law enforcement officer alleging that the respondent has failed to comply with the surrender of firearms
as required by an order issued under this chapter, the court
shall determine whether probable cause exists to believe
that the respondent has failed to surrender all firearms in his
or her possession, custody, or control. If probable cause exists, the court shall issue a warrant describing the firearms
and authorizing a search of the locations where the firearms

discovered pursuant to such search.
(5) If a person other than the respondent claims title to
any firearms surrendered pursuant to this section, and he or
she is determined by the law enforcement agency to be the
lawful owner of the firearm, the firearm shall be returned to
him or her, provided that:

order or ex parte extreme risk protection order issued under
this chapter into a statewide judicial information system on
the same day such order is issued.

each system for the period stated in the order, and the law
enforcement agency shall only expunge orders from the systems that have expired or terminated. Entry into the computer-based criminal intelligence information system constitutes notice to all law enforcement agencies of the existence
of the order. The order is fully enforceable in any county in
the state.

under this chapter is guilty of a gross misdemeanor, and further is prohibited from having in his or her custody or control, purchasing, possessing, or receiving, or attempting to
purchase or receive, a firearm for a period of five years from
the date the existing order expires. However, such person
is guilty of a class C felony if the person has two or more
previous convictions for violating an order issued under this
chapter.

(2) Violation of this section when the accused or an accomplice violates subsection (1) of this section and obtains
credit, money, goods, services, or anything else of value in
excess of one thousand five hundred dollars in value, or
when the accused knowingly targets a senior or vulnerable individual in carrying out a violation of subsection (1) of
this section, shall constitute identity theft in the first degree.
Identity theft in the first degree is a class B felony punishable

(4) Each crime prosecuted under this section shall be
punished separately under chapter 9.94A RCW, unless it is
the same criminal conduct as any other crime, under RCW
9.94A.589.
(5) Whenever any series of transactions involving a single person’s means of identification or financial information
which constitute identity theft would, when considered separately, constitute identity theft in the second degree because of value, and the series of transactions are a part of
a common scheme or plan, then the transactions may be
aggregated in one count and the sum of the value of all of
the transactions shall be the value considered in determining
the degree of identity theft involved.
(6) Every person who, in the commission of identity theft,
shall commit any other crime may be punished therefor as

crime separately.
(7) A person who violates this section is liable for civil damages of one thousand dollars or actual damages, whichever

PART II
INCREASING PENALTIES FOR CONSUMER FRAUD
AGAINST SENIORS AND VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS
(6) “Victim” means a person whose means of identification
or financial information has been used or transferred with
the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, any unlawful activity.
(7) “Vulnerable individual” means a person:
(i) Sixty years of age or older who has the functional,
mental, or physical inability to care for himself or herself;
(ii) Found incapacitated under chapter 11.88 RCW;

RCW 71A.10.020;
(iv) Admitted to any facility;

(vii) Who self-directs his or her own care and receives
services from a personal aide under chapter 74.39 RCW.
PART I
INCREASING CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR
IDENTITY THEFT
TARGETING SENIORS OR VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS
Sec. 4. RCW 9.35.001 and 2008 c 207 s 3 are each
amended to read as follows:
(1) The legislature finds that means of identification and
financial information are personal and sensitive information
such that if unlawfully obtained, possessed, used, or transferred by others may result in significant harm to a person’s
privacy, financial security, and other interests. The legislature finds that unscrupulous persons find ever more clever
ways, including identity theft, to improperly obtain, possess,
use, and transfer another person’s means of identification
or financial information. The legislature intends to penalize
for each unlawful act of improperly obtaining, possessing,
using, or transferring means of identification or financial information of an individual person. The unit of prosecution
for identity theft by use of a means of identification or financial information is each individual unlawful use of any one
person’s means of identification or financial information. Unlawfully obtaining, possessing, or transferring each means
of identification or financial information of any individual
person, with the requisite intent, is a separate unit of prosecution for each victim and for each act of obtaining, possessing, or transferring of the individual person’s means of
identification or financial information.
(2) The people find that additional measures are needed to
protect seniors and vulnerable individuals from identity theft
because such individuals often have less ability to protect
themselves and such individuals can be targeted using information available through public sources, including publicly
available information that identifies such individuals or their
in-home caregivers.
Sec. 5. RCW 9.35.020 and 2008 c 207 s 4 are each
amended to read as follows:
(1) No person may knowingly obtain, possess, use, or
transfer a means of identification or financial information of 
122
NEW SECTION. Sec. 6. A new section is added to read
as follows:
(1) It is the intent of this section to increase civil penalties
for consumer fraud targeting a senior or a vulnerable individual.
(2) Any consumer fraud that targets a senior or a vulnerable individual, as defined in RCW 9.35.005, is subject to civil
penalties of three times the amount of actual damages.
(3) This section creates no new cause of action. This section increases penalties where a plaintiff proceeds under any
existing cause of action under statute or common law and
successfully proves that he or she was victim to consumer
fraud that targeted him or her as a senior or vulnerable individual.
PART III
PROHIBITING THE RELEASE OF CERTAIN
PUBLIC RECORDS THAT COULD BE USED TO
VICTIMIZE SENIORS AND VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS

low-income persons, all funded by a phased-in carbon pollution tax on fossil fuels sold or used in this state and on the
consumption or generation in this state of electricity generated by the consumption of fossil fuels.
(2) Sections 4 through 8 of this act concern the carbon
pollution tax and the overall impact of this act; sections 9
through 13 of this act reduce the business and occupation
tax on manufacturers engaged in those activities subject
to the “manufacturing tax” categories identified in RCW
82.04.440(5)(c)(i); section 14 of this act reduces the state
sales tax; and section 15 of this act modifies and increases
the working families’ tax exemption.

chapter on fuel that is consumed in the generation of electricity, the electricity so generated or used will not be subject
to the tax imposed under this chapter provided that the department receives evidence, pursuant to rules adopted by
the department, that the tax has been paid by the person
using the fuel to generate electricity.
(5) Persons taxable under this chapter with respect to electricity consumed in this state but generated in another state
are allowed a credit against those taxes for any similar carbon pollution taxes paid to that other state on the fossil fuels
consumed in the generation of that electricity. The amount of
the credit may not exceed the tax liability arising under this
chapter with respect to the consumption of that electricity
in this state. Persons claiming this credit must provide the
department with evidence, pursuant to rules adopted by the
department, that the tax has been paid to another state.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 6. PROCEDURE. The provisions of

Initiative Measure No. 735
An Act Relating to the influence of corporations and money
in our political system; and creating new section.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF
WASHINGTON:
New Section. Sec. 1. INTENT
This act declares that the people of Washington State
support amending The Constitution of the United States
to eliminate the undue influence of concentrated money
and political power on elections and governmental policy.
The amendment would overturn decisions by the Supreme
Court of the United States extending constitutional rights to
corporations and other artificial legal entities as well as those
decisions equating the spending of money with free speech.
It also provides for the regulation and disclosure of political
contributions and spending.
New Section. Sec. 2. FINDINGS
1. Free and fair elections, as well as honest representation,
are essential to self-determination and self-governance
as described in The Declaration of Independence and
established in The Constitution of the United States.
2. The American people have lost faith in the political process
because their voices are not heard and their interests are
not represented. Thus, an ever smaller percentage of
Americans is motivated to vote.
3. The U.S. Constitution makes no mention of corporations
or other artificial entities; there are no provisions extending
rights to such entities. However, through a series of
decisions equating a “corporation” with a “person,”
the U.S. Supreme Court extended to corporations the
constitutional rights and protections intended for people
only.
4. Unlike human beings, corporations can exist in perpetuity
and in many countries at the same time. As a result many
large corporations, both foreign and domestic, invest in
campaigns to invalidate or bypass regulatory law intended
to protect the public. Thus, corporate participation in the
political process often conflicts with the public interest.
5. Money is property; it is not speech. Nowhere in the U.S.
Constitution is money equated with speech. Because
advertising is limited and costly, equating the spending of
money with free speech gives those with the most money
the most speech.
6. Whenever special interests, including very wealthy
individuals, are able to spend unlimited amounts of
money on political speech, candidates and officeholders
can be corrupted and intimidated, and the free speech of
most citizens is drowned out and denied. Monopolizing
public speech neither promotes nor protects free speech.
adopt such rules and regulations as necessary for the implementation and proper administration of this chapter and
may coordinate concerning the process, timelines, and documentation related to such rule making, as necessary.
(2) The department and the department of licensing may
commence administrative work, including rule making,
necessary to implement this act beginning July 1, 2016, as
deemed necessary.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 17. This chapter may be known and
cited as the carbon pollution tax act.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 18. Sections 1 through 8, 16, and 17
of this act constitute a new chapter in Title 82 RCW.
NEW SECTION. Sec. 19. This act takes effect July 1, 2017.
--- END ---
132
7. Anonymous contributions and spending for political
gain promote dishonesty and corruption, preventing
voters from assessing the motives of the speaker. The
public must be able to hold funders of political speech
accountable when their messages prove false or
misleading. Full and prompt disclosure of funding sources
is essential to an informed electorate, fair elections, and
effective governance.
8. Article V of the U.S. Constitution empowers the people
and the states to use the amendment process to correct
egregious decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court that
subvert our representative government.
New Section. Sec. 3. POLICY & PROMOTION
The voters of the State of Washington urge immediate action
by the current and future Washington State congressional
delegations to propose a joint resolution for an amendment
to The Constitution of the United States clarifying that:
1. The rights listed and acknowledged in The Constitution
of the United States are the rights of individual human
beings only.
2. The judiciary shall not construe the spending of money
to be free speech under the First Amendment of The
Constitution of the United States. Federal, state, and
local governments shall be fully empowered to regulate
political contributions and expenditures to ensure that no
person or artificial legal entity gains undue influence over
government and the political process.
3. All political contributions and expenditures shall be
disclosed promptly and in a manner accessible to voters
prior to elections.
4. This act does not limit the people’s rights to freedom of
speech, freedom of the press, free exercise of religion, or
freedom of association.
New Section. Sec. 4. RECOMMENDATION TO CONGRESS
In accordance with the U.S. Constitution, the voters of the
State of Washington urge the Washington state congressional
delegation, and the U.S. Congress generally, to include an
amendment ratification method which will best ensure that
the people are heard and represented during the ratification
process.
New Section. Sec. 5. RECOMMENDATION TO STATE LEGISLATURE
The voters of the State of Washington urge our current
and future Washington state legislatures to ratify such an
amendment when passed by Congress and delivered to the
states for ratification.
New Section. Sec. 6. DIRECTION TO SECRETARY OF STATE
The Washington Secretary of State is authorized and
directed to immediately deliver copies of this initiative, when
enacted, to the following persons: the governor of the State
of Washington, all current members of the Washington
Initiative Measure No. 735
State legislature, all current members of the United States
Congress, and the president of the United States.
New Section. Sec. 7. CONSTRUCTION.
The provisions of this act are to be liberally construed to
effectuate the intent, policies, and purposes of this act.
New Section. Sec. 8. SEVERABILITY.
If any provision of this act or its application to any person,
entity, or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the
act or the application of the provision to other persons,
artificial legal entities, or circumstances is not affected.
New Section. Sec. 9. MISCELLANEOUS.
This act is known and may be cited as the “Government of,
by, and for the People Act.”

to be selected as follows: The legislative leader of the two

appoint one voting member to the commission by January
15th of each year ending in one. By January 31st of each
year ending in one, the four appointed members, by an affirmative vote of at least three, shall appoint the remaining
member. The fifth member of the commission, who shall be
nonvoting, shall act as its chairperson. If any appointing authority fails to make the required appointment by the date established by this subsection, within five days after that date
the supreme court shall make the required appointment.
(3) No elected official and no person elected to legislative
district, county, or state political party office may serve on
the commission. A commission member shall not have been
an elected official and shall not have been an elected legislative district, county, or state political party officer within
two years of his or her appointment to the commission. The
provisions of this subsection do not apply to the office of
precinct committee person.
(4) The legislature shall enact laws providing for the implementation of this section, to include additional qualifications
for commissioners and additional standards to govern the
commission. The legislature shall appropriate funds to enable the commission to carry out its duties.
(5) Each district shall contain a population, excluding nonresident military personnel, as nearly equal as practicable to
the population of any other district. To the extent reasonable,
each district shall contain contiguous territory, shall be compact and convenient, and shall be separated from adjoining districts by natural geographic barriers, artificial barriers,
or political subdivision boundaries. The commission’s plan
shall not provide for a number of legislative districts different
than that established by the legislature. The commission’s

against any political party or group.
(6) The commission shall complete redistricting as soon
as possible following the federal decennial census, but no
later than ((January 1st)) November 15th of each year ending in ((two)) one. At least three of the voting members shall

limitations provided in this subsection, the supreme court
shall adopt a plan by April 30th of the year ending in two in
conformance with the standards set forth in subsection (5)
of this section.
(7) The legislature may amend the redistricting plan but
must do so by a two-thirds vote of the legislators elected or
appointed to each house of the legislature. Any amendment
must have passed both houses by the end of the thirtieth
day of the first session convened after the commission has
submitted its plan to the legislature. After that day, the plan,
with any legislative amendments, constitutes the state districting law.
(8) The legislature shall enact laws providing for the reconvening of a commission for the purpose of modifying a
districting law adopted under this section. Such reconvening requires a two-thirds vote of the legislators elected or
appointed to each house of the legislature. The commission
shall conform to the standards prescribed under subsection
(5) of this section and any other standards or procedures
that the legislature may provide by law. At least three of the
voting members shall approve such a modification. Any
modification adopted by the commission may be amended
by a two-thirds vote of the legislators elected and appointed to each house of the legislature. The state districting law
shall include the modifications with amendments, if any.
(9) The legislature shall prescribe by law the terms of commission members and the method of filling vacancies on the
commission.
(10) The supreme court has original jurisdiction to hear and
decide all cases involving congressional and legislative redistricting.
(11) Legislative and congressional districts may not be
changed or established except pursuant to this section. A
districting plan and any legislative amendments to the plan
are not subject to Article III, section 12 of this Constitution.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the secretary of state
shall cause notice of this constitutional amendment to be
published as least four times during the four weeks next preceding the election in every legal newspaper in the state.
